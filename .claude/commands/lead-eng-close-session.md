You are a Lead Engineer closing out a sprint implementation session.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Identify the Sprint

1. **Ask the user which sprint you just implemented:**
   - "Which sprint did you just complete? (e.g., Sprint 8.5, Sprint 8.6)"
   - If unclear, check `git status` for modified files and read sprint specs

2. **Read the sprint spec:**
   - Look in `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/sprints/SPRINT_[X]_SPEC.md`
   - Note the sprint items/goals from the spec
   - Check if there's already an "Implementation Notes" section (append if so)

### Step 2: Gather Implementation Knowledge

**Ask the user these questions interactively:**

1. **"Did the implementation match the spec, or were there significant deviations?"**
   - Example: "Spec assumed undo.data, but TW 3.x uses SQLite"
   - Capture architectural discoveries

2. **"What key technical decisions did you make during implementation?"**
   - Example: "Made checkbox sync always-on instead of opt-in"
   - Example: "Used regex pattern X for parsing because Y"

3. **"Any bugs or edge cases discovered and fixed?"**
   - Example: "Race condition in UUID extraction - fixed with retry logic"
   - Include line numbers if relevant

4. **"Any known issues or technical debt to document?"**
   - Example: "Large projects (>100 tasks) might be slow - defer to Sprint 10"
   - Be honest about limitations

5. **"Test results summary?"**
   - Total tests passing
   - Number of new tests added
   - Coverage notes (if relevant)

6. **"Any performance notes or benchmarks?"**
   - Example: "Checkbox sync: <100ms for 10 tasks"

7. **"Anything the PM should know when reviewing?"**
   - Example: "All State Sync enforcement verified manually"
   - Example: "Manual testing completed for reconciliation script"

### Step 3: Build Implementation Notes Section

**Create this section to append to the sprint spec:**

```markdown
---

## Implementation Notes (Lead Engineer - [DATE])

### Implementation Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Test Results:** [X] total tests passing ([Y] new tests added)
**Completion Date:** [DATE]

### What Actually Happened

[For each sprint item, note any deviations or interesting details]

**Item 1: [Name]**
- Implemented in: [file:line-numbers]
- Status: ‚úÖ Complete / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial / ‚ùå Deferred
- Notes: [Any deviations from spec, technical decisions, etc.]

**Item 2: [Name]**
[Similar format...]

### Key Technical Decisions

1. [Decision 1 with rationale]
2. [Decision 2 with rationale]
3. [etc...]

### Deviations from Spec

[List anything that worked differently than planned]
- **[What changed]:** [Why it changed]
- Example: "TaskWarrior 3.x uses SQLite operations table instead of undo.data - adapted reconciliation script accordingly"

### Bugs Fixed During Implementation

1. [Bug description] - [Solution] (file:line)
2. [etc...]

### Known Issues / Technical Debt

1. [Issue description] - [Recommendation for future]
2. [etc...]

### Performance Notes

- [Benchmark or performance observation]
- [etc...]

### Test Coverage

**New Tests Added:** [Y] tests
**Test Files:**
- `tests/[file].py`: [N] tests covering [what]
- [etc...]

**Manual Testing Completed:**
- [ ] [Test scenario 1]
- [ ] [Test scenario 2]
- [etc...]

### Files Modified

**Source Code:**
- `src/[file].py`: [Brief description of changes]
- [etc...]

**Tests:**
- `tests/[file].py`: [Brief description]
- [etc...]

**Scripts:**
- `scripts/[file].py`: [Brief description if applicable]

### Handoff to PM

**Ready for Review:**
- [ ] All items implemented and tested
- [ ] Code follows project patterns (TypedDict, pure functions, etc.)
- [ ] State Sync enforced (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated (or note what needs updating)
- [ ] No blocking issues

**PM Should Verify:**
1. [Specific thing to check]
2. [etc...]

**Next Steps:**
- [What should happen after PM reviews]

*Implementation completed by Lead Engineer instance on [DATE]*
```

### Step 4: Append to Sprint Spec

1. **Read the current sprint spec file**
2. **Check if "Implementation Notes" section already exists:**
   - If YES: Append update with timestamp
   - If NO: Add new section at end of file
3. **Write the updated content back**

### Step 5: Commit Everything

**Run these git commands:**

```bash
# Stage all implementation code
git add src/ tests/ scripts/

# Stage the updated sprint spec
git add Docs/sprints/SPRINT_[X]_SPEC.md

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "Sprint [X] Implementation Complete

[2-3 sentence summary of what was built]

Test results: [X] tests passing ([Y] new)
Key changes:
- [Major change 1]
- [Major change 2]
- [Major change 3]

See SPRINT_[X]_SPEC.md Implementation Notes for full details.

### Step 6: Provide Summary to User

**Output:**

```
‚úÖ Sprint [X] Implementation Session Closed

üìù Implementation Notes added to: Docs/sprints/SPRINT_[X]_SPEC.md
üíæ Committed: [N] source files, [M] test files
üß™ Tests: [X] passing ([Y] new)

Summary:
- [Key accomplishment 1]
- [Key accomplishment 2]
- [Key accomplishment 3]

Git commit: [commit hash] "Sprint [X] Implementation Complete"

PM should review:
- Implementation Notes in sprint spec
- [Specific items to verify]

Ready for PM review and sign-off.
```

## Important Guidelines

- **Don't modify PM_HANDOFF.md** - That's the PM's job
- **Be thorough** - Capture implementation knowledge while fresh
- **Be honest** - Document technical debt and known issues
- **Include line numbers** - Help PM find the code
- **Format for readability** - Use markdown formatting
- **Commit atomically** - All code + spec notes in one commit

## Error Handling

If you can't determine the sprint:
- List recent sprint specs and ask user to choose
- Check `git diff --stat` to see what was modified

If tests are failing:
- Note this in Implementation Notes
- Mark items as "‚ö†Ô∏è Partial" with explanation
- Don't commit - ask user if they want to anyway

If sprint spec doesn't exist:
- Error: "Sprint spec not found. Please specify correct sprint number."

## When Done

Confirm to user:
"Implementation session closed. Notes appended to SPRINT_[X]_SPEC.md and all code committed. Ready for PM review."
