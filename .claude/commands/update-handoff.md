You are updating the PM/Architect handoff document during your session.

## Your Task

1. **Read the current handoff:**
   - Open `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/PM_HANDOFF.md`
   - Check the last session number in SESSION HISTORY section
   - Review CURRENT STATE to see what you'll be updating

2. **Gather information for new session entry:**
   - What major work did you complete since last /update-handoff (or session start)?
   - Did any sprint statuses change? (COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE)
   - What documents did you modify?
   - Are there lead engineer handoff notes in any sprint specs to capture?
   - What must the next PM instance know or do?

3. **Append new session entry to SESSION HISTORY:**
   - Increment session number
   - Use format: `### Session [N] - [Date] [Time] (PM/Architect)`
   - Include:
     - **Participant:** PM Instance (describe what you did)
     - **What Happened:** Bullet points of work completed
     - **Lead Engineer Handoff:** Copy from sprint spec Implementation Summary if applicable
     - **Sprint Status Changes:** List any status changes with timestamps
     - **Documents Modified:** List all files you changed
     - **Next Session Must:** Critical tasks for continuity

4. **Update CURRENT STATE section at top:**
   - Update Active Sprints status if changed
   - Update Blocking Issues if any
   - Update "Next PM Instance Should" with current priorities
   - Update Last Updated By with current session info

5. **Update SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY if needed:**
   - If any sprint changed from INCOMPLETE to COMPLETE
   - Update table with completion date, test count, notes

6. **Verify no contradictions:**
   - Does CURRENT STATE match what you just wrote in SESSION HISTORY?
   - Do sprint statuses in SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY match session notes?
   - Are all modified documents listed?

## Important

- **Append** to SESSION HISTORY - never delete old sessions
- **Overwrite** CURRENT STATE - always show latest truth
- **Copy** lead engineer handoff notes - don't just reference them
- **Be thorough** - redundancy is OK, missing info is fatal
- **Timestamp** sprint status changes (e.g., "14:30")

## When Done

Confirm to user: "Updated HANDOFF.md with session notes. Current state reflects [brief summary]."
