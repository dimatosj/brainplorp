# PM/Architect Session Journal

## PURPOSE
This document is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for project state across PM/Architect instances.
- Append-only session log (never delete history)
- Current state always at top
- Sprint completion status is unambiguous
- Lead engineer handoff notes captured or referenced

---

## CURRENT STATE (Updated: 2025-10-07 17:00)

**Active Sprints:**
- Sprint 6: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-06)
- Sprint 7: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-07)

**Blocking Issues:**
- None

**Documentation Status:**
- Sprint 6 spec: ✅ Updated with completion notes
- Sprint 7 spec: ✅ Already has completion notes
- Handoff system: ✅ Fully operational

**Next PM Instance Should:**
1. Plan Sprint 8 (project/workstream/domain system based on user input)
2. Test handoff system with fresh instance
3. Address any user priorities

**Last Updated By:** PM Instance (Session 4 - Sprint 6 spec documentation complete)

## SESSION HISTORY (Append-Only)

### Session 3 - 2025-10-07 13:00-15:00 (PM/Architect)
**Participant:** PM Instance (reviewing Sprint 7, implementing handoff system)

**What Happened:**

**Phase 1: Sprint 7 Review (13:00-14:00)**
- User asked me to take on PM/Architect role
- Read WOPPER-PM-ARCHITECT.md and NEW_INSTANCE_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Read PM_HANDOFF.md (showed Sprint 6 "not started", Sprint 7 "ready")
- Reviewed Sprint 7 spec - lead engineer claimed "Step 1 Complete"
- **APPROVED INCORRECTLY** - Said Step 1-only was acceptable, didn't check MCP requirement
- User corrected me: Sprint 6 was already complete (2025-10-06)
- Lead engineer should have implemented MCP integration but deferred it

**Phase 2: Correction & Documentation (14:00-14:30)**
- Verified Sprint 6 MCP server exists (678 lines, 16 tools)
- Updated PM_HANDOFF.md to show Sprint 6 COMPLETE
- Updated SPRINT_7_SPEC.md to show INCOMPLETE (MCP missing)
- Lead engineer added MCP tool during session:
  - `plorp_process_daily_note` in mcp/server.py
  - `/process` slash command in .claude/commands/
  - 3 MCP tests added (328 total tests passing)
- Sprint 7 marked COMPLETE after MCP integration verified

**Phase 3: Handoff System Design (14:30-15:00)**
- User requested better handoff process to prevent context loss
- Designed append-only session journal system
- Created HANDOFF.md structure (this file)
- Creating NEW_INSTANCE_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Creating /update-handoff and /close-session commands

**Lead Engineer Handoff (from SPRINT_7_SPEC.md lines 1400-1626):**
> **Implementation Complete:** 2025-10-07
> **Time Spent:** ~5 hours total
>
> **Lines Written:**
> - src/plorp/parsers/nlp.py: 230 lines
> - src/plorp/core/process.py: 682 lines
> - src/plorp/mcp/server.py: ~60 lines (MCP integration)
> - tests/test_core/test_process.py: 676 lines
> - tests/test_mcp/test_process.py: ~150 lines (MCP tests)
> - .claude/commands/process.md: 15 lines
> - **Total:** ~2,000 lines
>
> **Test Coverage:**
> - 32 NLP parser tests (all passing)
> - 23 core process tests (all passing)
> - 3 MCP integration tests (all passing)
> - **328 total tests passing**
>
> **Key Decisions:**
> 1. Date parsing with preposition detection (triggers NEEDS_REVIEW)
> 2. String matching for task removal (Q21)
> 3. Liberal checkbox detection (Q9)
> 4. Automatic step detection (CLI and MCP)
> 5. MCP integration follows Sprint 6 patterns
>
> **Manual Testing:**
> - ✅ CLI: processed real daily note with 2 informal tasks
> - ✅ MCP: tool responds correctly for Step 1 and Step 2
> - ✅ Note reorganization working correctly

**Sprint Status Changes:**
- Sprint 7: "READY" → "Step 1 Complete" (prior to session, incorrect)
- Sprint 7: "Step 1 Complete" → "INCOMPLETE - MCP missing" (14:15)
- Sprint 7: "INCOMPLETE" → "COMPLETE" (14:30, after MCP integration)

**Documents Modified:**
- PM_HANDOFF.md - Updated Sprint 6/7 status (now rewritten entirely)
- SPRINT_7_SPEC.md - Marked incomplete, then complete after MCP added
- src/plorp/mcp/server.py - Lead engineer added plorp_process_daily_note tool
- .claude/commands/process.md - Lead engineer created slash command
- NEW_INSTANCE_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Being updated with new process

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- PM worked from stale PM_HANDOFF.md (said Sprint 6 "not started")
- Didn't verify codebase state before making approval decision
- Accepted lead engineer's MCP deferral without checking Sprint 6 status
- Sprint spec reading order unclear (should check dependencies first)

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Always verify codebase state, don't trust stale docs
2. Check sprint dependencies before approving deferrals
3. Append to journal DURING session, not just at end
4. Lead engineer handoff notes must be copied to HANDOFF.md
5. Sprint status must be binary: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE
6. Reading order matters - HANDOFF.md should be read FIRST

**Next Session Must:**
1. Plan Sprint 8 or next priorities with user
2. Verify handoff system works (new PM instance reads docs successfully)
3. Continue using /update-handoff and /close-session commands

### Session 4 - 2025-10-07 15:00-16:30 (PM/Architect)
**Participant:** PM Instance (completing handoff system implementation, cleanup)

**What Happened:**

**Phase 1: Handoff System Completion (15:00-16:00)**
- Completed implementation of handoff system after Session 3 setup
- Created PM_HANDOFF.md with full structure (360 lines):
  - CURRENT STATE section (always at top)
  - SESSION HISTORY (append-only journal)
  - SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY
  - ANTI-PATTERNS section documenting past errors
  - CRITICAL RULES for PM instances
- Rewrote NEW_INSTANCE_INSTRUCTIONS.md (409 lines):
  - Step-by-step startup process
  - Verification commands (grep/ls to check codebase)
  - Binary sprint status rules (COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE only)
  - Documentation priority order when conflicts exist
- Created slash commands:
  - `.claude/commands/update-handoff.md` - Update session journal during work
  - `.claude/commands/close-session.md` - Verify handoff before ending session

**Phase 2: Cleanup (16:00-16:30)**
- User identified `plorp_obsidian/` as side project to remove
- Cleaned up all references:
  - Removed logging interference comment from `src/plorp/mcp/server.py`
  - Updated `Docs/VAULT_SETUP.md` to use `/Users/jsd/vault`
  - Updated `Docs/MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` to generic paths
  - Updated `README.md` to remove from directory tree
  - Updated `CLAUDE.md` config example
  - Added `plorp_obsidian/` to `.gitignore`
- Verified no code dependencies remain (grep confirmed clean)

**Phase 3: System Testing (16:30)**
- Ran /update-handoff command (this session entry)
- Verified handoff system structure complete

**Phase 4: Sprint 6 Spec Documentation (16:45-17:00)**
- User identified discrepancy: SPRINT_6_SPEC.md showed "READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION" vs HANDOFF.md "COMPLETE"
- Added Implementation Summary section (133 lines):
  - Lines written breakdown (2,063 core, 741 MCP server)
  - All 16 MCP tools listed with descriptions
  - Key architectural decisions documented
  - Manual testing results
- Added Lead Engineer Handoff section (50 lines):
  - What was built, verification commands
  - Next sprint dependencies
  - Architecture pattern established
- Updated status line from "READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION" to "COMPLETE (2025-10-06)"
- Sprint 6 spec now self-documenting and matches Sprint 7 pattern

**Sprint Status Changes:**
- None (Sprint 6 & 7 already complete)
- Sprint 6 spec documentation: Incomplete → Complete

**Documents Modified:**
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/PM_HANDOFF.md` - Complete rewrite with session journal (Phase 1, 3, 4)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/prompts/NEW_INSTANCE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete rewrite (Phase 1)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/.claude/commands/update-handoff.md` - Created (Phase 1)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/.claude/commands/close-session.md` - Created (Phase 1)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/mcp/server.py` - Removed commented logging code (Phase 2)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/VAULT_SETUP.md` - Updated vault paths (Phase 2)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Genericized example paths (Phase 2)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/README.md` - Removed plorp_obsidian from tree (Phase 2)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/CLAUDE.md` - Updated vault path in config example (Phase 2)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/.gitignore` - Added plorp_obsidian/ to ignore list (Phase 2)
- `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/sprints/SPRINT_6_SPEC.md` - Added completion sections, updated status (Phase 4)

**Lead Engineer Handoff:**
- No new lead engineer work this session (PM-only session)

**System Verification:**
- ✅ 17 MCP tools exist (grep count confirmed)
- ✅ 10 core modules in src/plorp/core/
- ✅ Sprint 6 & 7 marked COMPLETE in specs
- ✅ No plorp_obsidian references in src/ or Docs/
- ✅ Handoff system commands created and functional

**Key Accomplishments:**
1. **Context preservation system** - Append-only session journal prevents information loss
2. **Verification-first approach** - Forces PM to check codebase vs docs with grep/ls commands
3. **Binary sprint status** - Eliminates ambiguity (only COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE allowed)
4. **Anti-patterns documentation** - Teaches future PM instances from Session 3's error
5. **Clean codebase** - Removed all side project references
6. **Sprint spec self-documentation** - Sprint 6 spec now has completion notes matching Sprint 7 pattern

**Next Session Must:**
1. Plan Sprint 8 based on user requirements (project/workstream/domain system)
2. Test handoff system with fresh PM instance
3. Continue using /update-handoff and /close-session for all sessions
4. Ensure all future sprint specs follow completion documentation pattern

**Notes for Next PM:**
- This is the first session using the new handoff system
- Read PM_HANDOFF.md BEFORE any other docs (it's now the source of truth)
- Run verification commands to ensure docs match codebase
- Use /update-handoff during session, /close-session before ending
- Sprint status is binary: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE (nothing else)

**Participant:** Lead Engineer (Sprint 6 implementation)

**What Happened:**
- Implemented Sprint 6 MCP-first rewrite
- Created core modules: daily, review, tasks, inbox, notes
- Created MCP server with 16 tools (src/plorp/mcp/server.py)
- Refactored CLI to use core functions
- All Sprint 6 phases completed (0-10)

**Sprint Status Changes:**
- Sprint 6: "Ready" → "COMPLETE"

**Documents Modified:**

---

## CORE DOCUMENTS REGISTRY

**Source of Truth Documents (Read in This Order):**

1. **PM_HANDOFF.md** (this file)
   - Location: `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/PM_HANDOFF.md`
   - Purpose: Current state + session history
   - Always read FIRST

2. **Active Sprint Specs**
   - SPRINT_6_SPEC.md - MCP architecture foundation (COMPLETE)
   - SPRINT_7_SPEC.md - Daily note processing (COMPLETE)
   - Check SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY for status

3. **MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md**
   - Location: `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
   - Purpose: Architecture patterns (TypedDict, pure functions, MCP-first)

4. **CLAUDE.md**
   - Location: `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/CLAUDE.md`
   - Purpose: General project overview for Claude Code instances
   - Warning: May be outdated on sprint status - trust HANDOFF.md

**How to Verify Current State:**
```bash
# Check MCP tools exist
grep "name=\"plorp_" /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/mcp/server.py

# Check core modules
ls /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/core/

# Check test status
pytest /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/tests/ --co -q

# Check sprint specs
grep "Status:" /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/sprints/SPRINT_*.md
```

**If Documentation Conflicts:**
- Priority: HANDOFF.md > Sprint specs > Other docs
- When in doubt, verify codebase directly
- Ask user for clarification

---

## CRITICAL RULES FOR PM/ARCHITECT INSTANCES

1. **Read HANDOFF.md FIRST** - Before reading anything else
2. **Verify codebase state** - Don't trust docs alone, use grep/ls commands
3. **Update session journal DURING work** - Use /update-handoff command
4. **Copy lead engineer handoff notes** - From sprint specs to SESSION HISTORY
5. **Sprint status is binary** - COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE (not "ready", "in progress", "step 1 done")
6. **Append to journal** - Never delete session history
7. **Update CURRENT STATE** - Overwrite with latest truth at top of file
8. **Check dependencies** - Before approving any sprint deferral
9. **Ask user when confused** - Better to ask than assume from docs
10. **Close session properly** - Run /close-session command before ending

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (What Went Wrong - Learn From This)

### ❌ Trusting Stale Handoff Docs
**What Happened:** Session 3 - PM read old PM_HANDOFF saying Sprint 6 "not started", approved Sprint 7 without MCP integration. Sprint 6 was actually complete day before.

**Why It Failed:** Didn't verify codebase state, trusted outdated documentation.

**Prevention:**
- Always run verification commands (grep for MCP tools, ls core modules)
- Ask user: "What work happened since last PM session?"
- Check file modification dates if suspicious

### ❌ Not Capturing Lead Engineer Handoff
**What Happened:** Session 1 - Sprint 6 completed but no handoff notes recorded initially.

**Why It Failed:** Handoff system didn't exist yet.

**Prevention:**
- Always copy "Implementation Summary" from sprint specs to HANDOFF.md SESSION HISTORY
- Include: lines written, tests passing, key decisions, manual testing results

### ❌ Accepting Deferrals Without Checking Dependencies
**What Happened:** Session 3 - Accepted MCP integration deferral without verifying Sprint 6 status.

**Why It Failed:** Trusted lead engineer's claim that "MCP framework not ready" without verification.

**Prevention:**
- Check SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY for dependencies
- Verify dependency exists/doesn't exist in codebase
- Never approve deferral of scope without checking if dependency is actually blocking

### ❌ Ambiguous Sprint Status
**What Happened:** Sprint 7 marked as "Step 1 Complete" instead of "INCOMPLETE".

**Why It Failed:** Non-binary status created confusion - is it done or not?

**Prevention:**
- Only use COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE
- INCOMPLETE means ANY scope is missing, ANY tests failing, ANY requirements unmet
- COMPLETE means 100% of spec implemented and verified

## SLASH COMMANDS FOR THIS SYSTEM

### /update-handoff
**When to use:** After completing significant work during session

**What it does:**
1. Appends new entry to SESSION HISTORY
2. Updates CURRENT STATE section
3. Captures lead engineer handoff notes from sprint specs
4. Records sprint status changes
5. Lists documents modified

### /close-session
**When to use:** Before ending your PM instance

**What it does:**
1. Reviews HANDOFF.md completeness
2. Checks all sprint specs have status updated
3. Verifies CURRENT STATE matches codebase reality
4. Ensures SESSION HISTORY entry exists for this session
5. Updates SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY
6. Flags any missing information

---

## PROJECT CONTEXT (Background)

**Project:** plorp v1.1 - MCP-first task management system
**Stack:** Python 3.8+, TaskWarrior 3.4.1, Obsidian (markdown vault)
**Architecture:** Core modules (TypedDict) → MCP/CLI wrappers

**What plorp does:**
- Workflow automation layer between TaskWarrior and Obsidian
- Daily notes with tasks from TaskWarrior
- Inbox processing (email → tasks/notes)
- Review workflow (end-of-day task processing)
- Natural language task parsing (`/process` command)

**v1.0 → v1.1 Transition:**
- v1.0: CLI-first, workflows/ modules
- v1.1: MCP-first, core/ modules with TypedDict returns
- Breaking change: workflows/ removed, CLI commands unchanged

**Current state:** v1.1 core complete (Sprints 6 & 7)

---

## NEXT SPRINTS (Future Work)

**Sprint 8 Candidates:**
- Project detection ("work on plorp" → `project:plorp`)
- Tag extraction ("#important" → `tag:important`)
- Additional date formats (next month, in 3 days, Oct 15)
- Time parsing (3pm, at 14:00)

**Sprint 9+ Candidates:**
- Recurring task patterns ("every Monday")
- Context/location awareness
- Additional workflows

**Priority:** TBD by user
