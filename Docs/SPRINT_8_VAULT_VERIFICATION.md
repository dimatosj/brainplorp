# Sprint 8 Vault Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Issue:** Manual test guide referenced wrong vault path
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Documentation fixed, implementation is correct

---

## Summary

The Sprint 8 implementation is **CORRECT** and uses the proper vault path. Only the manual test documentation had incorrect references, which have now been fixed.

---

## Verification Results

### ✅ Configuration is Correct

**File:** `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml`
```yaml
vault_path: /Users/jsd/vault  # ✅ CORRECT
```

**Code:** `src/plorp/config.py`
```python
DEFAULT_CONFIG: Dict[str, Any] = {
    "vault_path": os.path.expanduser("~/vault"),  # ✅ CORRECT
    ...
}
```

### ✅ Implementation Uses Config Correctly

**Sprint 8 Code:** `src/plorp/integrations/obsidian_bases.py`
```python
from ..config import get_vault_path

def get_projects_dir() -> Path:
    return get_vault_path() / "projects"  # ✅ Uses config
```

This correctly reads from `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml` which points to `/Users/jsd/vault`.

### ✅ Projects Created in Correct Location

**Actual projects found:**
```bash
$ ls -la /Users/jsd/vault/projects/
-rw-r--r-- work.engineering.api-rewrite.md
-rw-r--r-- work.marketing.website-redesign.md
-rw-r--r-- work.marketing.website.md
```

**Deprecated vault (empty, as expected):**
```bash
$ ls -la /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/plorp_obsidian/projects/
total 0
```

---

## What Was Wrong

**Issue:** The manual test guide at `Docs/manual test journeys/MANUAL_TEST_SPRINT_8_USER_JOURNEY.md` incorrectly referenced:
- ❌ `plorp_obsidian` (deprecated development vault)
- ❌ `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/plorp_obsidian`

**Why this happened:** PM instance created test documentation that referenced the old deprecated vault path.

**What was correct:**
- ✅ All Sprint 8 source code
- ✅ All Sprint 8 tests
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Actual project files created

---

## What Was Fixed

### Documentation Updates

**File:** `Docs/manual test journeys/MANUAL_TEST_SPRINT_8_USER_JOURNEY.md`

**Changes:**
1. Test environment section: Updated vault path to `/Users/jsd/vault`
2. All command examples: Changed `plorp_obsidian/projects/` → `/Users/jsd/vault/projects/`
3. Expected outputs: Updated file paths to correct vault
4. Troubleshooting: Updated to reference config file

**Total replacements:** 12 occurrences fixed

---

## Historical Context

From `Docs/PM_HANDOFF.md` Session 2:

> **Phase 2: Cleanup (14:30-15:00)**
> - User identified `plorp_obsidian/` as side project to remove
> - Lead engineer cleaned up all references
> - Updated `Docs/VAULT_SETUP.md` to use `/Users/jsd/vault`
> - Added `plorp_obsidian/` to `.gitignore`

**Result:** The codebase was correctly cleaned up in Session 2. The Sprint 8 manual test guide was created later and accidentally used the old deprecated path.

---

## Lead Engineer Action Items

### ✅ Already Complete (No Action Needed)

1. ✅ Sprint 8 implementation uses correct vault
2. ✅ Configuration is correct
3. ✅ Projects created in correct location
4. ✅ Documentation fixed by PM

### 📋 Future Checklist (For Next Sprints)

When creating new features that interact with the vault:

1. **Always use `get_vault_path()` from config**
   ```python
   from plorp.config import get_vault_path

   vault = get_vault_path()  # Never hardcode vault path
   projects_dir = vault / "projects"
   ```

2. **Never hardcode vault paths** in:
   - Source code
   - Tests (use `tmp_path` fixture and mock `get_vault_path`)
   - Documentation
   - Example commands

3. **Reference config in documentation**
   ```markdown
   Vault location is configured in `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml`
   Default: `/Users/jsd/vault`
   ```

4. **Verify vault in tests**
   ```python
   def test_feature(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
       monkeypatch.setattr("plorp.config.get_vault_path", lambda: tmp_path)
       # Test uses tmp_path, not hardcoded vault
   ```

---

## Verification Commands

To verify Sprint 8 is using correct vault:

```bash
# 1. Check config
cat ~/.config/plorp/config.yaml

# 2. Check actual projects created
ls -la /Users/jsd/vault/projects/

# 3. Test project creation
brainplorp project create --name "test-verify" --domain "personal"

# 4. Verify it went to correct vault
ls /Users/jsd/vault/projects/personal.test-verify.md

# 5. Clean up test
brainplorp project delete personal.test-verify
```

Expected: All operations should use `/Users/jsd/vault/`, not `plorp_obsidian/`.

---

## Conclusion

**Sprint 8 Status: ✅ VERIFIED CORRECT**

- Implementation: ✅ Uses correct vault via config
- Projects: ✅ Created in `/Users/jsd/vault/projects/`
- Tests: ✅ Use mocked vault paths
- Documentation: ✅ Fixed to reference correct vault

No code changes needed. Sprint 8 is ready for user testing.
