# plorp Vault Configuration

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Purpose:** Document the Obsidian vault location for plorp development

---

## Vault Location

**Development vault**: `/Users/jsd/vault`

This vault is configured in `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml`.

---

## Vault Structure

```
vault/
├── .obsidian/          # Obsidian configuration (managed by Obsidian)
├── daily/              # Daily notes (generated by plorp)
├── inbox/              # Monthly inbox files (YYYY-MM.md)
├── notes/              # General notes
├── projects/           # Project notes
└── Welcome.md          # Obsidian default welcome file
```

---

## Configuration

When running plorp during development, use this vault path in your config:

**File**: `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml`

```yaml
vault_path: /Users/jsd/vault
taskwarrior_data: ~/.task
inbox_email: null
default_editor: vim
```

---

## For Engineering Instances

When implementing sprints that interact with the vault:

1. **Use this absolute path** for development: `/Users/jsd/vault`
2. **Test vault structure** is already created with subdirectories:
   - `daily/` - for daily notes
   - `inbox/` - for inbox files
   - `notes/` - for general notes
   - `projects/` - for project notes
3. **Obsidian metadata** in `.obsidian/` should be ignored by plorp code

---

## Testing

For tests, use the `tmp_vault` fixture from `conftest.py` which creates a temporary vault structure. Do NOT use the actual development vault in automated tests.

## Project Management (Sprint 8)

### Obsidian Bases Plugin

Install the Bases plugin from Community Plugins to enable dynamic project dashboards.

### Project Dashboard Setup

Create `vault/_bases/projects.base` with this content:

```yaml
---
title: Projects Dashboard
description: All projects organized by domain
---

# Projects Dashboard

## Active Projects

```query
path:projects/ state:active
```

## By Domain

### Work Projects
```query
path:projects/ domain:work state:active
```

### Home Projects
```query
path:projects/ domain:home state:active
```

### Personal Projects
```query
path:projects/ domain:personal state:active
```

## Planning
```query
path:projects/ state:planning
```

## Completed
```query
path:projects/ state:completed
```
```

### Project Note Structure

Projects are created in `vault/projects/` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
domain: work
workstream: marketing
project_name: website-redesign
full_path: work.marketing.website-redesign
state: active
created_at: '2025-10-07T14:30:00'
description: Company website redesign project
task_uuids:
  - abc-123-def
  - ghi-456-jkl
needs_review: false
tags:
  - project
  - work
  - marketing
---

# Website Redesign

## Overview
Company website redesign project

## Tasks
<!-- Linked TaskWarrior tasks -->

## Notes
<!-- Project documentation -->
```

### Project Hierarchy

- **Domain**: `work` / `home` / `personal` (top-level)
- **Workstream**: Area of responsibility (e.g., `marketing`, `engineering`)
- **Project**: Specific initiative (e.g., `website-redesign`)

Full path example: `work.marketing.website-redesign`

2-segment projects (no workstream) are flagged with `needs_review: true`.
