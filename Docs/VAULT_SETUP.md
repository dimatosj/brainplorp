# plorp Vault Configuration

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Purpose:** Document the Obsidian vault location for plorp development

---

## Vault Location

**Development vault**: `/Users/jsd/vault`

This vault is configured in `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml`.

---

## Vault Structure

```
vault/
├── .obsidian/          # Obsidian configuration (managed by Obsidian)
├── daily/              # Daily notes (generated by plorp)
├── inbox/              # Monthly inbox files (YYYY-MM.md)
├── notes/              # General notes
├── projects/           # Project notes
└── Welcome.md          # Obsidian default welcome file
```

---

## Configuration

When running plorp during development, use this vault path in your config:

**File**: `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml`

```yaml
vault_path: /Users/jsd/vault
taskwarrior_data: ~/.task
inbox_email: null
default_editor: vim
```

---

## For Engineering Instances

When implementing sprints that interact with the vault:

1. **Use this absolute path** for development: `/Users/jsd/vault`
2. **Test vault structure** is already created with subdirectories:
   - `daily/` - for daily notes
   - `inbox/` - for inbox files
   - `notes/` - for general notes
   - `projects/` - for project notes
3. **Obsidian metadata** in `.obsidian/` should be ignored by plorp code

---

## Testing

For tests, use the `tmp_vault` fixture from `conftest.py` which creates a temporary vault structure. Do NOT use the actual development vault in automated tests.
