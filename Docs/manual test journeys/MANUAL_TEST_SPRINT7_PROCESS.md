# brainplorp v1.3.0 - Manual Test Journey for /process Workflow (Sprint 7)

**Purpose:** Walk through the complete `/process` workflow to verify informal task conversion to TaskWarrior tasks.

**Prerequisites:**
- brainplorp v1.3.0 installed (`uv pip install -e .` from project root)
- TaskWarrior 3.x installed and configured
- Obsidian vault configured in `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml`
- Daily note exists with informal tasks

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes

---

## Journey Overview

You're a busy professional who jots down informal tasks in your daily note throughout the day. You want to convert these informal tasks into proper TaskWarrior tasks without manually creating each one. The `/process` workflow:

1. **Step 1:** Scans your daily note for informal tasks (checkboxes without UUIDs)
2. **Step 1:** Generates proposals with smart date/priority parsing
3. **You:** Review and approve/reject each proposal
4. **Step 2:** Creates TaskWarrior tasks from approved proposals
5. **Step 2:** Reorganizes your note (removes approved, keeps rejected)

---

## Setup: Create Test Daily Note

### Test Data

Create or modify today's daily note with informal tasks:

```bash
# Open today's daily note
vim ~/vault/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

**Add this content:**

```markdown
# Daily Note - 2025-10-07

**Date:** Tuesday, October 07, 2025

## 📋 Tasks

## 📝 Notes

- [ ] call mom today about birthday
- [ ] finish quarterly report by Friday - this is urgent!
- [ ] review John's PR on Invalid-Date

## Random Thoughts

- [ ] buy groceries
- [ ] existing formal task (uuid: abc-123-def-456)
```

**Save and close.**

---

## Journey Part 1: Step 1 - Proposal Generation

### Action 1.1: Run brainplorp process (First Time)

**Command:**
```bash
brainplorp process
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Scanned daily note: /Users/jsd/vault/daily/2025-10-07.md

📊 Found 4 informal task(s)
⚠️  1 task(s) need review
   (Could not parse date - check TBD section)

✅ Added proposals to ## TBD Processing section

Next steps:
  1. Open your daily note
  2. Review each proposal in ## TBD Processing
  3. Mark [Y] to approve or [N] to reject
  4. Run 'brainplorp process' again to create tasks
```

**What Happened:**
- ✅ Scanned entire note for informal tasks (checkboxes without UUIDs)
- ✅ Ignored formal task with UUID
- ✅ Found 4 informal tasks
- ✅ Parsed dates: "today" → 2025-10-07, "Friday" → 2025-10-10
- ✅ Detected "urgent" → priority H
- ✅ Detected unparseable date "Invalid-Date" → NEEDS_REVIEW
- ✅ Created TBD section

### Action 1.2: Inspect TBD Section

**Command:**
```bash
cat ~/vault/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

**Expected TBD Section:**

```markdown
## TBD Processing

- [ ] **[Y/N]** call mom about birthday
	- Proposed: `description: "call mom about birthday", due: 2025-10-07, priority: L`
	- Original location: 📝 Notes (line 11)

- [ ] **[Y/N]** finish quarterly report
	- Proposed: `description: "finish quarterly report", due: 2025-10-10, priority: H`
	- Original location: 📝 Notes (line 12)
	- Reason: detected 'urgent'

- [ ] **[Y/N]** review John's PR on Invalid-Date
	- Proposed: `description: "review John's PR on Invalid-Date", priority: L`
	- Original location: 📝 Notes (line 13)
	- *NEEDS_REVIEW: Could not parse date*

- [ ] **[Y/N]** buy groceries
	- Proposed: `description: "buy groceries", priority: L`
	- Original location: Random Thoughts (line 16)
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Each task has [Y/N] checkbox
- ✅ Proposals are tab-indented
- ✅ Metadata includes description, due (if parsed), priority
- ✅ Reason shown for priority H ("detected 'urgent'")
- ✅ NEEDS_REVIEW marker for unparseable date (italics format)
- ✅ Original location captured correctly

---

## Journey Part 2: User Review

### Action 2.1: Edit Daily Note - Approve/Reject Tasks

**Edit the note:**
```bash
vim ~/vault/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

**Make these decisions:**

1. **call mom about birthday** → `[Y]` (Approve)
2. **finish quarterly report** → `[Y]` (Approve - urgent!)
3. **review John's PR on Invalid-Date** → `[N]` (Reject - NEEDS_REVIEW, fix later)
4. **buy groceries** → `[N]` (Reject - not a task, just a thought)

**Updated TBD Section:**

```markdown
## TBD Processing

- [Y] **[Y/N]** call mom about birthday
	- Proposed: `description: "call mom about birthday", due: 2025-10-07, priority: L`
	- Original location: 📝 Notes (line 11)

- [Y] **[Y/N]** finish quarterly report
	- Proposed: `description: "finish quarterly report", due: 2025-10-10, priority: H`
	- Original location: 📝 Notes (line 12)
	- Reason: detected 'urgent'

- [N] **[Y/N]** review John's PR on Invalid-Date
	- Proposed: `description: "review John's PR on Invalid-Date", priority: L`
	- Original location: 📝 Notes (line 13)
	- *NEEDS_REVIEW: Could not parse date*

- [N] **[Y/N]** buy groceries
	- Proposed: `description: "buy groceries", priority: L`
	- Original location: Random Thoughts (line 16)
```

**Save and close.**

## Journey Part 3: Step 2 - Task Creation

### Action 3.1: Run brainplorp process (Second Time)

**Command:**
```bash
brainplorp process
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Processed approvals: /Users/jsd/vault/daily/2025-10-07.md

✅ Created 2 task(s) in TaskWarrior
❌ Rejected 2 task(s) (kept in original location)

✅ All tasks processed - TBD section removed
```

**What Happened:**
- ✅ Detected TBD section → ran Step 2
- ✅ Parsed [Y] approvals (2 tasks)
- ✅ Parsed [N] rejections (2 tasks)
- ✅ Created 2 TaskWarrior tasks
- ✅ Removed approved tasks from original locations
- ✅ Kept rejected tasks in original locations
- ✅ Removed TBD section (no errors/NEEDS_REVIEW remaining)

### Action 3.2: Verify Tasks Created in TaskWarrior

**Command:**
```bash
task list
```

**Expected Output:**

```
ID Age  Due        Description                   Urg Pri
-- ---- ---------- ----------------------------- ---- ---
 1 1min 2025-10-07 call mom about birthday       10.8 L
 2 1min 2025-10-10 finish quarterly report       12.3 H

2 tasks
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ 2 tasks created
- ✅ Descriptions match proposals
- ✅ Due dates correct (today and Friday)
- ✅ Priorities correct (L and H)

### Action 3.3: Inspect Reorganized Daily Note

**Command:**
```bash
cat ~/vault/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

**Expected Note Structure:**

```markdown
# Daily Note - 2025-10-07

**Date:** Tuesday, October 07, 2025

## Tasks
- [ ] call mom about birthday (due: 2025-10-07, priority: L, uuid: <uuid-1>)
- [ ] finish quarterly report (due: 2025-10-10, priority: H, uuid: <uuid-2>)

## 📋 Tasks

```

**Verify:**
- ✅ **## Tasks section**: TODAY/URGENT tasks added (both qualify: today + H priority)
- ✅ **📝 Notes section**: Approved task removed, rejected task kept
- ✅ **Random Thoughts section**: Both tasks kept (1 rejected, 1 formal)
- ✅ **## Created Tasks section**: All created tasks listed
- ✅ **## TBD Processing section**: REMOVED (no errors)
- ✅ Each created task has formal metadata (due, priority, uuid)

---

## Journey Part 4: Edge Cases

### Test 4.1: NEEDS_REVIEW Workflow

**Setup:** Create a new daily note with unparseable date:

```bash
echo "## Notes
- [ ] meeting on SomeDate" > ~/vault/daily/2025-10-08.md
```

**Run Step 1:**
```bash
brainplorp process --date 2025-10-08
```

**Expected:**
```
✅ Scanned daily note: /Users/jsd/vault/daily/2025-10-08.md

📊 Found 1 informal task(s)
⚠️  1 task(s) need review
   (Could not parse date - check TBD section)

✅ Added proposals to ## TBD Processing section
```

**Inspect TBD:**
```bash
cat ~/vault/daily/2025-10-08.md
```

**Expected:**
```markdown
## TBD Processing

- [ ] **[Y/N]** meeting on SomeDate
	- Proposed: `description: "meeting on SomeDate", priority: L`
	- Original location: Notes (line 2)
	- *NEEDS_REVIEW: Could not parse date*
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ NEEDS_REVIEW marker present
- ✅ Explanation clear ("Could not parse date")

**Approve the task:**
```bash
# Edit and change [ ] to [Y]
sed -i '' 's/- \[ \] \*\*\[Y\/N\]\*\*/- [Y] **[Y\/N]**/' ~/vault/daily/2025-10-08.md
```

**Run Step 2:**
```bash
brainplorp process --date 2025-10-08
```

**Expected:**
```
✅ Processed approvals: /Users/jsd/vault/daily/2025-10-08.md

📋 No approved tasks found
💡 Mark tasks with [Y] in ## TBD Processing section
```

Wait, this is wrong. It should skip NEEDS_REVIEW items even if marked [Y]. Let me check the expected behavior.

Actually, according to the spec, NEEDS_REVIEW items are skipped and kept in TBD. Let me update:

**Expected:**
```
✅ Processed approvals: /Users/jsd/vault/daily/2025-10-08.md

✅ Created 0 task(s) in TaskWarrior
⚠️  1 error(s) occurred
   (Check TBD section for NEEDS_REVIEW items)

⚠️  TBD section kept - fix NEEDS_REVIEW items and run again
```

**Verify TBD Still Present:**
```bash
cat ~/vault/daily/2025-10-08.md | grep "TBD Processing"
```

**Expected:**
```
## TBD Processing
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ TBD section still present
- ✅ NEEDS_REVIEW item NOT created in TaskWarrior
- ✅ User warned to fix and run again

---

### Test 4.2: Checked Task Creation

**Setup:** Create task that's already checked:

```bash
echo "## Notes
- [x] completed task today" > ~/vault/daily/2025-10-09.md
```

**Run full workflow:**
```bash
# Step 1
brainplorp process --date 2025-10-09

# Edit to approve: [Y]
sed -i '' 's/- \[ \] \*\*\[Y\/N\]\*\*/- [Y] **[Y\/N]**/' ~/vault/daily/2025-10-09.md

# Step 2
brainplorp process --date 2025-10-09
```

**Verify task in TaskWarrior:**
```bash
task all | grep "completed task"
```

**Expected:**
```
ID UUID Status    Description
-- ---- --------- ----------------
 X uuid Completed completed task
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Task created
- ✅ Status = Completed (not Pending)

---

## Notes for Testers

**What's Working Well:**
- Natural language date parsing feels intuitive
- Priority detection ("urgent") works as expected
- TBD section format is clear and editable
- Automatic step detection is seamless

**What to Watch For:**
- NEEDS_REVIEW items must be manually edited in proposals
- Rejected tasks stay in original location (expected, but confirm)
- TBD section only removed when ALL errors resolved

**Future Improvements (Sprint 8+):**
- Project detection: "work on plorp" → `project:plorp`
- Tag extraction: "#important" → `tag:important`
- More date formats: "next month", "in 3 days"
- Time parsing: "3pm", "at 14:00"
