# Sprint 10.3: Vault Sync via CouchDB + Obsidian LiveSync

**Created:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** 📋 READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Sprint Type:** Major Feature (MINOR version increment)
**Target Version:** v1.7.0
**Estimated Effort:** 9 hours
**Dependencies:** Sprint 10 (Mac Installation & Multi-Computer Sync) must be complete

---

## Executive Summary

Implement automatic, real-time vault synchronization across multiple devices (Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android) using CouchDB as the sync server and Obsidian's LiveSync plugin as the client.

**Key Philosophy:** Users get automatic, real-time sync without managing anything. Edit on Mac, see changes on iPhone instantly.

**Architecture:** Pure CouchDB - single source of truth for vault data, accessed by both users (via LiveSync plugin) and brainplorp server (via HTTP API).

**Why CouchDB?**
- ✅ Real-time automatic sync (2-5 seconds)
- ✅ Mobile support (iOS/Android via LiveSync)
- ✅ No manual sync commands needed
- ✅ Server HTTP API for automation
- ✅ Built-in conflict resolution (MVCC)
- ✅ Battle-tested replication protocol
- ✅ Self-hostable on Fly.io (free tier)

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**No Multi-Device Support:**
- brainplorp only works on one Mac
- Can't capture tasks on iPhone
- Can't access vault from multiple computers
- Manual file syncing via iCloud/Dropbox is error-prone

**Manual Sync is Fragile:**
- User must remember to sync before switching devices
- iCloud/Dropbox conflicts corrupt files
- No conflict resolution built-in
- Lost work when conflicts happen

**No Mobile Capture:**
- User has great idea on iPhone
- Can't add to inbox until back at Mac
- Ideas forgotten, tasks missed

### Success Criteria

1. **Automatic Sync:** User never runs sync commands, happens in background
2. **Real-Time:** Changes sync within 5 seconds across all devices
3. **Mobile Support:** Works on iPhone, iPad, Android (via Obsidian mobile)
4. **Conflict Resolution:** Automatic handling of simultaneous edits
5. **Transparent Setup:** `brainplorp setup` configures everything, user just enables plugin
6. **Server Integration:** brainplorp server can read/write vault via HTTP API
7. **Offline Support:** User can work offline, changes sync when reconnected
8. **Status Visibility:** User can check sync health with `brainplorp vault status`

```

**Single Source of Truth:** CouchDB database contains all vault files as documents.

**Three Clients:**
1. **Obsidian + LiveSync** (Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android) - Real-time sync for users
2. **brainplorp server** (Fly.io) - HTTP API for automation (email fetch, scheduled tasks)
3. **Other Obsidian clients** (future) - Any device running Obsidian mobile

### Document Structure in CouchDB

Each vault file becomes a CouchDB document:

```json
{
  "_id": "daily/2025-10-12.md",
  "_rev": "3-abc123def",
  "type": "markdown",
  "path": "daily/2025-10-12.md",
  "content": "# Daily Note - 2025-10-12\n\n## Tasks\n- [ ] Review inbox",
  "mtime": "2025-10-12T14:30:00Z",
  "ctime": "2025-10-12T08:00:00Z",
  "size": 256,
  "deleted": false
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `_id`: File path (unique identifier)
- `_rev`: CouchDB revision (for MVCC conflict detection)
- `content`: Actual markdown content
- `mtime`: Last modified timestamp
- `deleted`: Tombstone for deleted files

**LiveSync manages this structure automatically** - users and brainplorp server just see files.

### Conflict Resolution via MVCC

**Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** means each document update requires the current revision number.

**Scenario: User edits on Mac while server adds email to inbox**

```
Step 1: Initial State
  inbox/2025-10.md (_rev: "1-xyz")
  Content: "- [ ] Old task"

Step 2: Simultaneous Edits
  Mac LiveSync:
    Reads: _rev "1-xyz"
    Adds: "- [ ] Buy groceries"
    Attempts update with _rev "1-xyz"
    → Success! New _rev: "2-abc"

  Server HTTP API:
    Reads: _rev "1-xyz" (stale)
    Adds: "- [ ] Email: Client meeting"
    Attempts update with _rev "1-xyz"
    → Rejected! CouchDB says: "Conflict - rev mismatch"

Step 3: Server Retries
  Server reads latest: _rev "2-abc"
  Sees Mac's changes: "- [ ] Buy groceries"
  Merges: "- [ ] Buy groceries\n- [ ] Email: Client meeting"
  Updates with _rev "2-abc"
  → Success! New _rev: "3-def"

Step 4: Mac Syncs
  LiveSync polls CouchDB
  Sees _rev "3-def" (newer than local "2-abc")
  Downloads merged content
  User sees both items in Obsidian
```

**Result:** No data loss, automatic conflict resolution.

**If true conflict (same line edited):**
- CouchDB keeps both versions
- LiveSync creates conflict file: `inbox/2025-10.conflicted.md`
- User reviews and merges manually

### Server HTTP API Access

brainplorp server can read/write vault directly via CouchDB HTTP API:

**Example 1: Fetch emails to inbox (Sprint 10.2 feature)**

```
1. Server fetches emails from Gmail
2. Server reads current inbox document via HTTP GET:
   GET https://couch.brainplorp.com/user-jsd-vault/inbox%2F2025-10.md

3. Server appends emails to content:
   - [ ] Email: Project deadline moved
   - [ ] Email: Team standup at 2pm

4. Server updates document via HTTP PUT:
   PUT https://couch.brainplorp.com/user-jsd-vault/inbox%2F2025-10.md
   Body: {content: "...", _rev: "5-abc"}

5. Mac LiveSync polls, sees new _rev, downloads changes
6. User opens Obsidian, sees new emails in inbox automatically
```

**Example 2: Read today's tasks for analytics**

```
1. Server queries CouchDB:
   GET https://couch.brainplorp.com/user-jsd-vault/daily%2F2025-10-12.md

2. Server parses markdown content
3. Server analyzes tasks (completed, pending, overdue)
4. Server generates metrics (no write needed)
```

**Example 3: Batch read for weekly summary**

```
1. Server queries multiple documents:
   POST https://couch.brainplorp.com/user-jsd-vault/_all_docs?include_docs=true
   Body: {
     "keys": [
       "daily/2025-10-06.md",
       "daily/2025-10-07.md",
       "daily/2025-10-08.md",
       "daily/2025-10-09.md",
       "daily/2025-10-10.md",
       "daily/2025-10-11.md",
       "daily/2025-10-12.md"
     ]
   }

2. Receives all 7 documents in one HTTP response
3. Analyzes week's task completion rate
4. Sends summary email to user
```

**No Git needed, no working directories, just HTTP requests.**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CouchDB Server Deployment (2 hours)

**Goal:** Deploy self-hosted CouchDB instance on Fly.io

**Deliverables:**
- CouchDB Docker container running on Fly.io
- HTTPS endpoint with SSL certificate
- Admin credentials configured
- Volume mounted for persistent data
- Fly.io app configured for auto-restart

**Files to create/modify:**
- `deploy/couchdb.Dockerfile` - CouchDB container image
- `deploy/couchdb-fly.toml` - Fly.io configuration
- `deploy/couchdb-config.ini` - CouchDB settings (CORS, auth)

**Deployment steps:**
1. Build CouchDB Docker image with custom config
2. Deploy to Fly.io (alongside TaskChampion sync server)
3. Create persistent volume for database storage
4. Configure HTTPS with Fly.io's automatic SSL
5. Test: HTTP GET to verify CouchDB responds

**Success criteria:**
- `curl https://couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev/` returns CouchDB welcome JSON
- Admin panel accessible: `https://couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev/_utils/`
- Database persists across container restarts

---

### Phase 2: User Setup Wizard Integration (2 hours)

**Goal:** Extend `brainplorp setup` to configure CouchDB + LiveSync

**User flows:**

**Flow 1: First Computer**
1. User runs `brainplorp setup`
2. brainplorp creates CouchDB database for user via HTTP API
3. brainplorp generates unique username/password
4. brainplorp creates `vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-livesync/data.json` with credentials
5. brainplorp installs LiveSync plugin if not present
6. brainplorp displays credentials for user to save
7. User opens Obsidian, enables LiveSync plugin
8. LiveSync syncs vault to CouchDB automatically

**Flow 2: Additional Computer**
1. User runs `brainplorp setup` on new Mac
2. brainplorp prompts: "Do you have CouchDB credentials?"
3. User pastes credentials from Computer 1
4. brainplorp configures LiveSync with same database
5. User opens Obsidian, enables LiveSync
6. Vault downloads from CouchDB automatically

**Flow 3: Mobile Device**
1. User installs Obsidian on iPhone
2. User creates empty vault
3. User goes to Settings → Community Plugins → Browse
4. User installs "Self-hosted LiveSync"
5. User enters CouchDB credentials (from Computer 1)
6. Vault syncs automatically

**Files to create/modify:**
- `src/brainplorp/commands/setup.py` - Add vault sync step
- `src/brainplorp/integrations/couchdb.py` - HTTP client for CouchDB API
- `src/brainplorp/utils/livesync_config.py` - Generate LiveSync config JSON

**Key functions:**
- `create_couchdb_database(username)` - Create user's vault database
- `generate_couchdb_credentials()` - Create username/password pair
- `configure_livesync_plugin(vault_path, credentials)` - Write plugin config
- `verify_livesync_sync(vault_path)` - Check if LiveSync is syncing

**Success criteria:**
- `brainplorp setup` on Computer 1 completes without errors
- User can paste credentials into Computer 2's setup
- LiveSync plugin config JSON is valid and loads in Obsidian
- User opens Obsidian and sees sync happening (status indicator)

---

### Phase 3: Server HTTP API Client (2 hours)

**Goal:** Python library for brainplorp server to access vault via CouchDB

**Use cases:**
1. **Email to inbox** (Sprint 10.2): Append email bullets to `inbox/YYYY-MM.md`
2. **Read daily note** (analytics): Parse today's tasks for completion tracking
3. **Batch reads** (reporting): Read week's daily notes for summary
4. **Create notes** (automation): Generate project notes from templates

**Library interface:**

```
VaultClient(server_url, database, username, password)
  .read_document(path) → document content
  .write_document(path, content) → success/failure
  .update_document(path, update_fn) → handles MVCC retries
  .list_documents(prefix) → list of document IDs
  .batch_read(paths) → dict of path → content
```

**Features:**
- Automatic MVCC retry on conflict (exponential backoff)
- Connection pooling for performance
- Error handling with clear messages
- Logging for debugging
- Unit tests with mock CouchDB

**Files to create:**
- `src/brainplorp/integrations/vault_client.py` - HTTP client library
- `tests/test_vault_client.py` - Unit tests

**Example usage (email to inbox):**

```
High-level pseudocode:

vault = VaultClient(couch_url, "user-jsd-vault", username, password)

def append_email(email_text):
    current_month = "2025-10"
    inbox_path = f"inbox/{current_month}.md"

    def add_bullet(content):
        return content + f"\n- [ ] Email: {email_text}"

    vault.update_document(inbox_path, add_bullet)
    # update_document handles MVCC retries automatically
```

**Success criteria:**
- Can read document from CouchDB via HTTP GET
- Can write document via HTTP PUT with MVCC
- MVCC conflicts retry automatically (tested with concurrent writes)
- Error messages are clear ("Document not found", "Auth failed", etc.)
- Unit tests pass with 100% coverage

---

### Phase 4: CouchDB Views for Analytics (1 hour)

**Goal:** Optimize batch queries using CouchDB map/reduce views

**Problem:** Reading 30 daily notes individually = 30 HTTP requests (slow)

**Solution:** CouchDB views index documents, allow fast queries

**Views to create:**

**View 1: Daily notes by date**
```
Purpose: Get all daily notes in date range for weekly/monthly summaries
Query: /vault/_design/brainplorp/_view/daily_by_date?startkey="2025-10-01"&endkey="2025-10-31"
Returns: List of daily note documents for October
```

**View 2: Tasks by status**
```
Purpose: Count completed vs pending tasks across all daily notes
Query: /vault/_design/brainplorp/_view/tasks_by_status?group=true
Returns: {pending: 42, completed: 158}
```

**View 3: Inbox items by month**
```
Purpose: Track inbox processing rate (unprocessed vs processed items per month)
Query: /vault/_design/brainplorp/_view/inbox_items?group=true
Returns: {"2025-10": {unprocessed: 12, processed: 45}}
```

**Implementation:**
- Create design document with map/reduce functions
- Upload to CouchDB via HTTP PUT
- Query views in analytics code
- Compare performance (view vs. multiple doc reads)

**Files to create:**
- `deploy/couchdb-design-docs.json` - View definitions
- `src/brainplorp/analytics/views.py` - Query view helper functions

**Success criteria:**
- Views return correct results (validated against manual parsing)
- Query performance: <1 second for 30 days of data
- Views update automatically as documents change

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (2 hours)

**Testing scenarios:**

**Multi-device sync:**
1. Edit file on Mac 1
2. Verify appears on iPhone within 5 seconds
3. Edit same file on iPhone
4. Verify Mac 1 sees changes
5. Edit simultaneously on Mac 1 and iPhone
6. Verify conflict handled (no data loss)

**Offline/online:**
1. Disconnect Mac 1 from internet
2. Create new daily note
3. Reconnect
4. Verify syncs to CouchDB
5. Verify Mac 2 receives new note

**Server operations:**
1. Server appends email to inbox via API
2. Verify Mac sees email in Obsidian
3. Server reads daily note via API
4. Verify content matches Obsidian view

**MVCC conflict resolution:**
1. Server reads inbox (rev: 1-abc)
2. Mac edits inbox (creates rev: 2-def)
3. Server tries to write with stale rev 1-abc
4. Verify server detects conflict
5. Verify server retries with rev 2-def
6. Verify no data lost

**Performance:**
1. Sync 100 small files (daily notes)
2. Measure time to sync
3. Goal: <10 seconds
4. Sync 10MB file (PDF attachment)
5. Goal: <30 seconds

**Documentation to write:**

1. **User Guide: Setting up vault sync**
   - First computer setup
   - Additional computer setup
   - Mobile device setup
   - Troubleshooting common issues

2. **Developer Guide: Server HTTP API**
   - Reading documents
   - Writing documents
   - Handling MVCC conflicts
   - Batch operations
   - View queries

3. **Architecture Doc: Why CouchDB**
   - Comparison with other solutions
   - Trade-offs and limitations
   - Performance characteristics
   - Scaling considerations

**Files to create:**
- `Docs/VAULT_SYNC_USER_GUIDE.md`
- `Docs/VAULT_SYNC_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- `Docs/VAULT_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Success criteria:**
- All test scenarios pass
- Documentation is clear and complete
- User can follow guide and set up vault sync successfully
- Developer can write server automation using API guide

## Configuration

### User Config (~/.config/brainplorp/config.yaml)

```yaml
vault_path: /Users/jsd/vault

taskwarrior_sync:
  enabled: true
  server: https://brainplorp-sync.fly.dev
  client_id: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
  encryption_secret: abc123def456...

vault_sync:
  enabled: true
  method: couchdb
  server: https://couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev
  database: user-jsd-vault
  username: user-jsd
  password: [encrypted password]
```

### LiveSync Plugin Config (vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-livesync/data.json)

```json
{
  "couchDB_URI": "https://couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev",
  "couchDB_USER": "user-jsd",
  "couchDB_PASSWORD": "...",
  "couchDB_DBNAME": "user-jsd-vault",
  "liveSync": true,
  "syncOnSave": true,
  "syncOnStart": true,
  "conflictResolutionStrategy": "automatic"
}
```

**brainplorp setup writes this file automatically.**

---

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Capture Task on iPhone

```
Context: User at grocery store, remembers task

1. User opens Obsidian on iPhone
2. Opens inbox/2025-10.md
3. Adds: "- [ ] Buy milk"
4. Closes Obsidian
5. LiveSync syncs automatically (3 seconds)

Later that day:
6. User opens Obsidian on Mac
7. Runs: brainplorp inbox process
8. Sees "Buy milk" in inbox
9. Creates TaskWarrior task from inbox item
10. TaskWarrior syncs to server
11. Task appears in today's daily note on all devices
```

**Key insight:** User never thought about syncing - it just worked.

### Workflow 2: Server Fetches Emails to Inbox

```
Context: Cron job runs on brainplorp server every 15 minutes

1. Server fetches emails from Gmail via IMAP
2. For each unread email:
   - Parse subject/body to markdown bullet
   - Read current month's inbox via CouchDB HTTP GET
   - Append email bullet to inbox content
   - Update inbox via CouchDB HTTP PUT (with MVCC)
3. If MVCC conflict (user edited inbox simultaneously):
   - Server retries with latest revision
   - Merges server's emails with user's edits
4. User opens Obsidian on Mac
5. LiveSync synced new emails automatically
6. User sees emails in inbox, processes with `brainplorp inbox process`
```

**Key insight:** Server and user can both write to vault without conflicts.

### Workflow 3: Weekly Summary Report

```
Context: User wants weekly task completion summary

1. User runs: brainplorp report weekly
2. brainplorp server queries CouchDB view:
   - Get all daily notes from last 7 days
   - View returns indexed data (fast)
3. brainplorp parses task lists from each daily note
4. brainplorp calculates:
   - Total tasks: 87
   - Completed: 64 (74%)
   - Pending: 23 (26%)
   - Overdue: 5
5. brainplorp displays rich table in terminal
6. Optional: Email summary to user
```

**Key insight:** CouchDB views make analytics fast, no need to read 7 documents individually.

## Trade-offs and Limitations

### What CouchDB + LiveSync Does Well

✅ **Real-time automatic sync** - Best-in-class UX, no manual commands
✅ **Mobile support** - Works on iPhone/iPad/Android via Obsidian mobile
✅ **Conflict resolution** - MVCC handles simultaneous edits gracefully
✅ **Server HTTP API** - Easy for brainplorp server to read/write vault
✅ **Battle-tested** - CouchDB is mature, used by millions
✅ **Self-hostable** - Runs on Fly.io free tier, user owns data
✅ **Offline support** - Edit offline, syncs when reconnected
✅ **Scalable** - CouchDB handles large vaults (GBs) efficiently

### Limitations and Workarounds

❌ **Requires Obsidian plugin** - Users must install and enable LiveSync
**Mitigation:** brainplorp setup installs plugin automatically, user just enables it

❌ **Entire vault syncs** - Can't selectively sync only brainplorp directories
**Mitigation:** CouchDB is efficient with incremental sync, bandwidth not a problem for text files
**Future:** Could extend LiveSync to support selective sync (advanced feature)

❌ **CouchDB is another service** - More complexity than Git
**Mitigation:** Docker makes deployment trivial, Fly.io handles restarts/SSL automatically

❌ **No built-in encryption at rest** - CouchDB stores data unencrypted on disk
**Mitigation:** Fly.io volumes are encrypted, network traffic is HTTPS
**Future:** Could implement application-level encryption (encrypt content before storing in CouchDB)

❌ **Plugin maintenance** - If LiveSync breaks, users can't sync
**Mitigation:** LiveSync is widely used (10,000+ users), actively maintained
**Fallback:** Users can still use brainplorp on single device, export vault to file

### Compared to Git Automation

**CouchDB wins on:**
- Real-time automatic sync (Git requires manual `brainplorp vault sync`)
- Mobile support (Git requires CLI, not available on iOS/Android)
- Server API simplicity (HTTP requests vs. Git subprocess calls)
- Conflict resolution (MVCC built-in vs. custom merge logic)

**Git would win on:**
- Selective sync (only brainplorp directories)
- Familiarity (developers know Git)
- Version history (full audit trail)

**Decision:** Real-time sync + mobile support are critical for user experience. CouchDB is the right choice.

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

**Per-user credentials:**
- Each user gets unique CouchDB username/password
- Generated by brainplorp during setup (strong random password)
- Stored in user's config file (encrypted at rest by OS)
- Never shared across users

**HTTP authentication:**
- All requests require username/password (HTTP Basic Auth)
- HTTPS enforces encrypted transport (Fly.io automatic SSL)
- CouchDB validates credentials on every request

### Data Privacy

**User data isolation:**
- Each user gets separate CouchDB database (e.g., `user-jsd-vault`)
- CouchDB enforces database-level permissions
- User A cannot read User B's database

**Network security:**
- All communication over HTTPS (TLS 1.3)
- Fly.io provides automatic SSL certificates
- No plaintext passwords on wire

**At-rest encryption:**
- Fly.io volumes encrypted by default
- CouchDB data files encrypted at OS level
- Future: Application-level encryption (encrypt content field before storing)

### Threat Model

**Protected against:**
- ✅ Network eavesdropping (HTTPS)
- ✅ Unauthorized database access (per-user auth)
- ✅ Cross-user data leakage (separate databases)
- ✅ Server disk theft (Fly.io volume encryption)

**Not protected against:**
- ⚠️ brainplorp server compromise (server has access to all user vaults via HTTP API)
- ⚠️ User credential theft (if attacker gets username/password, can access vault)
- ⚠️ Obsidian plugin vulnerability (malicious plugin could read vault)

**Future improvements:**
- End-to-end encryption (encrypt on client, decrypt on client, server stores ciphertext)
- Token-based auth (refresh tokens, scope-limited access)
- Audit logs (track all vault modifications)

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Sync Speed

**Initial sync (new device):**
- Small vault (50 notes, 500KB): <5 seconds
- Medium vault (500 notes, 5MB): <30 seconds
- Large vault (5000 notes, 50MB): <3 minutes

**Incremental sync (daily use):**
- Single file edit (5KB): 2-5 seconds
- 10 files edited (50KB): 5-10 seconds
- Large file (1MB): 10-15 seconds

**Factors:**
- Network latency (Fly.io to user)
- CouchDB server load
- Number of concurrent users
- File size

### Server API Performance

**Single document read:**
- HTTP GET: <100ms (including network round-trip)
- Document size: No impact for typical notes (<100KB)

**Batch read (7 daily notes):**
- Using `_all_docs?include_docs=true`: <200ms
- Without view: 7 HTTP requests = ~700ms
- Recommendation: Use batch endpoint for >3 documents

**CouchDB view query:**
- Indexed query (e.g., daily notes by date): <100ms
- First query builds index: <1 second for 100 documents
- Subsequent queries: Fast (index cached)

**Write operations:**
- HTTP PUT: <150ms (including MVCC validation)
- MVCC conflict retry: +100ms per retry (rare)

### Scalability

**Fly.io free tier limits:**
- 3 shared VMs
- 256MB RAM per VM
- 3GB storage
- 160GB bandwidth/month

**CouchDB on 256MB RAM:**
- Can handle ~1000 documents (typical vault size)
- Performance degrades with >10,000 documents (rare)
- Upgrade to paid tier if needed ($7/month for 1GB RAM)

**Concurrent users:**
- Free tier: 1-5 users comfortable
- Paid tier: 50+ users per instance
- CouchDB replication allows multi-datacenter scaling (future)

---

## Migration Path

### From No Sync → CouchDB

**User currently has local-only vault:**

1. User runs `brainplorp setup` → configures CouchDB
2. User enables LiveSync in Obsidian
3. LiveSync uploads entire vault to CouchDB (one-time, <1 minute)
4. User sets up additional devices with same credentials
5. All devices sync automatically

**No data loss risk:** Original vault stays local, CouchDB is additive.

### From iCloud/Dropbox → CouchDB

**User currently syncs via iCloud:**

1. User runs `brainplorp setup` → configures CouchDB
2. User enables LiveSync in Obsidian
3. LiveSync uploads vault to CouchDB
4. User can keep iCloud as backup (no conflict)
5. LiveSync takes over as primary sync method

**Recommendation:** Disable iCloud sync for vault folder to avoid conflicts.

### From Git (if Sprint 10.3 had used Git) → CouchDB

**Future migration if we change approaches:**

1. Export Git repository to filesystem
2. Run `brainplorp vault migrate-to-couchdb`
3. brainplorp reads all files, uploads to CouchDB as documents
4. Git history preserved in CouchDB revision history (partial)
5. User enables LiveSync, continues with CouchDB

**Estimated migration time:** 10 files/second = 100 files in 10 seconds.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

**Risk:** LiveSync plugin breaks in future Obsidian update
**Impact:** Users can't sync vault
**Mitigation:**
- LiveSync is actively maintained with 10,000+ users
- Community would fix critical issues quickly
- Fallback: Users can still use brainplorp on single device
**Contingency:** Fork LiveSync if abandoned, maintain our own version

**Risk:** CouchDB data corruption (rare but catastrophic)
**Impact:** User loses vault data
**Mitigation:**
- CouchDB is battle-tested, data corruption extremely rare
- Fly.io volumes have automatic snapshots (daily)
- User's local Obsidian vault is always source of truth (can re-upload)
**Contingency:** Implement automatic daily backups to S3 (Sprint 11)

### Medium Risk

**Risk:** MVCC conflicts cause data loss (implementation bug)
**Impact:** User's edits overwritten by server/other device
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive testing of concurrent writes (Phase 5)
- Start with conservative retry logic (abort on ambiguous conflicts)
- Monitor conflict rate in production
**Contingency:** Add conflict logging, alert on high conflict rate

**Risk:** CouchDB performance degrades with large vault (>10,000 files)
**Impact:** Slow sync, poor user experience
**Mitigation:**
- Most vaults have <1,000 files (typical user)
- CouchDB handles 10,000 documents comfortably on 256MB RAM
- Can upgrade Fly.io instance if needed ($7/month for 1GB RAM)
**Contingency:** Implement sharding (split vault across multiple databases)

### Low Risk

**Risk:** Setup wizard fails to install LiveSync plugin
**Impact:** User must install plugin manually
**Mitigation:**
- Document manual installation steps clearly
- Most users already have LiveSync installed
**Contingency:** User installs plugin from Community Plugins (5 seconds)

**Risk:** HTTP API authentication credentials leak
**Impact:** Attacker can read/write user's vault
**Mitigation:**
- Credentials stored encrypted in user's config file
- HTTPS prevents network sniffing
- Each user has unique credentials (blast radius limited)
**Contingency:** Implement token rotation, audit logs

**Lead Engineer:** Claude (Session: current)

### Blocking Questions (Must Answer Before Starting)

**Q1: CouchDB Deployment Location**
- Should CouchDB be deployed to the same Fly.io app as TaskChampion server (brainplorp-sync.fly.dev) or a separate app (couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev)?
- **Concern:** Spec shows `couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev` but also references existing `brainplorp-sync.fly.dev`
- **Impact:** Affects Dockerfile naming and deployment strategy

**Q2: Sprint 10.2 Dependency**
- Spec says "Sprint 10.2 (Cloud Sync - TaskWarrior) must be complete"
- PM_HANDOFF.md shows Sprint 10.2 doesn't exist in session history
- Is this referring to Sprint 10.1 (Homebrew installation) which is already complete?
- **Impact:** Blocking - can't start if dependency unclear

**Q3: CouchDB Version**
- Spec says "CouchDB 3.x" - which specific version should I use? (3.3.3 is latest stable)
- **Impact:** Docker image selection

**Q4: LiveSync Plugin Installation**
- Should `brainplorp setup` automatically install the LiveSync plugin?
- Or should it only check for installation and guide user to install manually?
- Obsidian Community Plugins API isn't documented - is auto-install even possible?
- **Impact:** Phase 2 scope and implementation complexity

**Q5: Server CouchDB Credentials**
- Phase 3 requires server HTTP API to access vault
- Should server use same credentials as user? Or separate admin credentials?
- Who manages server credentials (user via config.yaml or hardcoded)?
- **Impact:** Security model and Phase 3 implementation

### High-Priority Questions (Need Before Phase X)

**Q6: Persistent Volume Size (Phase 1)**
- What size persistent volume for CouchDB storage?
- Spec mentions "Volume mounted for persistent data" but no size specified
- **Suggestion:** 10GB for free tier?
- **Impact:** Fly.io resource allocation

**Q7: CORS Configuration (Phase 1)**
- Should CouchDB CORS be enabled for LiveSync WebSocket connections?
- What origins should be allowed (localhost, all)?
- **Impact:** couchdb-config.ini contents

**Q8: Password Encryption (Phase 2)**
- Spec says: "password: [encrypted password]" in config.yaml
- What encryption algorithm? (AES-256-GCM, Fernet, OS keychain?)
- Where is encryption key stored?
- **Impact:** Security implementation

**Q9: Existing LiveSync Config Handling (Phase 2)**
- If user already has LiveSync configured (different server), should brainplorp:
  - Overwrite existing config?
  - Merge with existing config?
  - Abort and warn user?
- **Impact:** Phase 2 error handling

**Q10: MVCC Retry Strategy (Phase 3)**
- What retry parameters for MVCC conflicts?
- **Suggestion:** Exponential backoff starting at 100ms, max 5 retries?
- What to do if all retries fail?
- **Impact:** vault_client.py implementation

**Q11: Connection Pooling (Phase 3)**
- How many HTTP connections in pool?
- **Suggestion:** 10 connections with keep-alive?
- **Impact:** Performance tuning

**Q12: Email-to-Inbox Integration (Phase 3)**
- Spec mentions integrating with "email-to-inbox automation"
- Is this Sprint 9.2 feature (`brainplorp inbox fetch`)?
- Should Phase 3 modify existing `inbox.py` to use CouchDB instead of filesystem?
- **Impact:** Phase 3 scope - are we refactoring existing code or just creating library?

### Medium-Priority Questions (Nice to Have)

**Q13: CouchDB View Upload Timing (Phase 4)**
- When should design documents be uploaded to CouchDB?
- During server deployment (Phase 1)?
- During user setup (Phase 2)?
- Lazy initialization on first analytics query?
- **Impact:** Phase 4 implementation strategy

**Q14: View Requirement for Sign-Off (Phase 4)**
- Are CouchDB views required for Sprint 10.3 completion?
- Or can they be deferred to Sprint 11 (analytics enhancement)?
- Spec shows Phase 4 in "Should Have" success criteria, not "Must Have"
- **Impact:** Whether to implement Phase 4 or defer

**Q15: iPhone Testing Requirement (Phase 5)**
- Is iPhone testing required for PM sign-off?
- Or can I test with two Macs only?
- I don't have an iPhone - should I ask John to test mobile?
- **Impact:** Testing strategy

**Q16: Mock Library for Unit Tests (Phase 5)**

- Should integration tests use real CouchDB in Docker?
- Or mock CouchDB responses?
- **Suggestion:** Real CouchDB container via testcontainers-python?
- **Impact:** Test infrastructure setup

### Low-Priority Questions (Clarifications)

**Q18: Database Naming Validation**
- Should brainplorp validate CouchDB database names?
- CouchDB requires lowercase, no special chars except hyphen/underscore
- Should we sanitize OS username (e.g., "John Smith" → "john-smith")?
- **Impact:** Phase 2 username generation logic

**Q19: Conflict File Detection (Phase 5)**
- When LiveSync creates `.conflicted.md` files, should brainplorp detect and warn?
- Or leave conflict resolution entirely to user?
- **Impact:** `brainplorp vault status` command scope

**Q20: Version Bump Responsibility**
- Spec targets v1.7.0 (MINOR bump from current 1.6.2)

- Or does PM handle version bumps during sign-off?
- **Impact:** Whether to update `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`

**Q21: State Synchronization Interaction**
- Does vault sync via CouchDB affect existing State Sync pattern?
- Currently: TaskWarrior modifications → Update Obsidian vault files
- With CouchDB: Do we write to local vault files or CouchDB directly?
- **Concern:** Might create inconsistency if brainplorp bypasses LiveSync
- **Impact:** Core architecture decision

**Q22: Backward Compatibility**
- Should brainplorp continue working without vault sync enabled?
- Or is CouchDB required after Sprint 10.3?
- **Suggestion:** Make vault sync optional (user can skip in setup)
- **Impact:** Configuration validation logic

**Q23: Test Count Expectation**
- How many new tests expected for Sprint 10.3?
- **Estimate:** ~20-25 tests (5 for CouchDB client, 5 for config generation, 10 for integration)
- **Impact:** Test coverage target

**Q24: LiveSync Plugin Exact Name**
- Spec references both "Self-hosted LiveSync" and "obsidian-livesync"
- What's the exact plugin ID for Community Plugins?
- **Impact:** Plugin detection logic in Phase 2

## PM Answers to Lead Engineer Questions

**Status:** ✅ ALL ANSWERED (24/24)
**PM:** Claude (Session 21)
**Date:** 2025-10-12

### CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL CLARIFICATION (Q21 - Elevated to Blocking)

**Q21 was originally marked "Low Priority" but is actually BLOCKING - it affects the core State Synchronization pattern.**

**Q21: State Synchronization Interaction with CouchDB**

**Answer:** The State Sync pattern CHANGES based on execution context:

**Context 1: Local brainplorp CLI (user at Mac)**
```
User runs: brainplorp start
1. brainplorp queries TaskWarrior for tasks
2. brainplorp writes daily note to LOCAL vault files (existing behavior)
3. LiveSync detects file change, syncs to CouchDB automatically (2-5s)
4. Other devices (Mac 2, iPhone) see changes via LiveSync sync from CouchDB

State Sync: TaskWarrior write → Local vault file write → LiveSync syncs
✅ Maintains existing State Sync pattern
✅ LiveSync handles propagation to other devices
```

**Context 2: Server automation (brainplorp server on Fly.io)**
```
Server runs: email fetch automation
1. brainplorp server fetches emails from Gmail
2. brainplorp server writes to CouchDB via HTTP API (no local files)
3. All devices (Mac 1, Mac 2, iPhone) sync from CouchDB via LiveSync

State Sync: Email fetch → CouchDB write → LiveSync syncs to all clients
✅ Server has no local vault, must use CouchDB
✅ All clients stay in sync via LiveSync
```

**Context 3: Multi-device TaskWarrior sync (State Sync preserved)**
```
User marks task done on Mac 1:
1. brainplorp marks task done in TaskWarrior (CLI)
2. brainplorp updates local daily note checkbox (State Sync)
3. brainplorp updates local project frontmatter to remove UUID (State Sync)
4. LiveSync detects vault file changes, syncs to CouchDB
5. Mac 2 and iPhone receive updates via LiveSync

State Sync: TaskWarrior → Local Obsidian files → LiveSync propagates
✅ State Sync pattern preserved on local device
✅ LiveSync ensures other devices stay consistent
```

**KEY PRINCIPLE: Local operations write to local files (State Sync pattern), LiveSync handles multi-device propagation. Server operations write to CouchDB (no local files available).**

**Implementation Rules:**
1. **If `vault_path` is local file path** → Write to local files, LiveSync syncs automatically
2. **If running on server (no vault_path)** → Write to CouchDB via HTTP, LiveSync syncs to clients
3. **State Sync enforcement** → Always happens at point of write (local or CouchDB)
4. **LiveSync is transparent** → brainplorp treats it as automatic propagation layer

**Code Implications:**
- `core/daily.py`, `core/tasks.py` → Continue writing to local files when executed locally
- `integrations/vault_client.py` (NEW) → Server-only, writes to CouchDB via HTTP
- `core/process.py` → When marking task done, update local files (State Sync), LiveSync handles rest

**This is BLOCKING because it defines the fundamental architecture. All phases depend on this decision.**

---

### Blocking Questions - Answers

**Q1: CouchDB Deployment Location**

**Answer:** **Use SEPARATE Fly.io app** (`couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev`)

**Rationale:**
- CouchDB and TaskChampion server have different resource requirements
- CouchDB needs persistent volume (database storage), TaskChampion is stateless
- Separate apps allow independent scaling
- CouchDB might need upgrade to larger instance (user vault grows), TaskChampion stays on free tier
- Easier to debug and monitor when separated

**Action:** Create `deploy/couchdb-fly.toml` targeting app name `couch-brainplorp-sync`

---

**Q2: Sprint 10.2 Dependency**

**Answer:** **Spec error - "Sprint 10.2" should be "Sprint 10"**

**Correction:**
- Sprint 10 (Mac Installation & Multi-Computer Sync) included TaskChampion server deployment
- Sprint 10 is COMPLETE (v1.6.0 released)
- Fly.io infrastructure already exists: `brainplorp-sync.fly.dev` (TaskChampion server)
- Sprint 10.3 will add CouchDB to same Fly.io account, different app

**Dependency Status:** ✅ SATISFIED - Sprint 10 complete, Fly.io account active

**Action:** Update spec line 8 and line 1437: Change "Sprint 10.2" → "Sprint 10"

---

**Q3: CouchDB Version**

**Answer:** **Use CouchDB 3.3.3** (latest stable as of October 2024)

**Docker Image:** `couchdb:3.3.3` (official image)

**Why 3.3.3:**
- Latest stable release (battle-tested)
- LiveSync plugin officially supports CouchDB 3.x
- MVCC improvements over 2.x
- Better performance for mobile clients

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM couchdb:3.3.3
COPY couchdb-config.ini /opt/couchdb/etc/local.d/
```

---

**Q4: LiveSync Plugin Installation**

**Answer:** **Check for installation, guide user to install manually**

**Rationale:**
- Obsidian Community Plugins API is not public/documented
- Plugin installation requires Obsidian restart, can't automate reliably
- Most users can install plugins (5 seconds via UI)
- Auto-install would require reverse-engineering Obsidian internals (brittle)

**Implementation:**
```python
def configure_livesync(vault_path, credentials):
    plugin_dir = vault_path / ".obsidian/plugins/obsidian-livesync"

    if not plugin_dir.exists():
        click.echo("❌ LiveSync plugin not installed")
        click.echo("\nTo install:")
        click.echo("1. Open Obsidian")
        click.echo("2. Settings → Community Plugins → Browse")
        click.echo("3. Search 'Self-hosted LiveSync'")
        click.echo("4. Click Install, then Enable")
        click.echo("5. Run 'brainplorp setup' again")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Plugin installed, write config
    config_file = plugin_dir / "data.json"
    write_livesync_config(config_file, credentials)
    click.echo("✅ LiveSync configured")
```

**User Experience:** Clear instructions, users install plugin once, works across all vaults

---

**Q5: Server CouchDB Credentials**

**Answer:** **Server uses same credentials as user** (NOT separate admin credentials)

**Security Model:**
- Each user gets unique CouchDB username/password
- Server stores credentials in Fly.io secrets (encrypted)
- Server reads user's credentials from config when running automation
- No shared admin credentials (blast radius limited to one user if leaked)

**Implementation:**
```python
# Server reads from config.yaml
vault_sync:
  server: https://couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev
  database: user-jsd-vault
  username: user-jsd
  password: [encrypted]  # Server decrypts when needed

# Server uses same credentials as user
vault_client = VaultClient(
    server=config['vault_sync']['server'],
    database=config['vault_sync']['database'],
    username=config['vault_sync']['username'],
    password=decrypt(config['vault_sync']['password'])
)
```

**Why not admin credentials:**
- Server should have same permissions as user
- Easier to revoke if compromised (rotate one user's credentials)
- Aligns with principle of least privilege

---

### High-Priority Questions - Answers

**Q6: Persistent Volume Size (Phase 1)**

**Answer:** **10GB persistent volume** (Fly.io free tier allows up to 3GB free, 10GB is $0.15/GB/month = $1.50/month)

**Rationale:**
- Typical Obsidian vault: 10-100 MB (mostly text)
- CouchDB metadata + revisions + compaction: 5x overhead
- 10GB supports vault up to 2GB (extremely large) with room to grow
- Free tier 3GB volume is sufficient for most users, but 10GB is safer

**Fly.io config:**
```toml
[mounts]
  source = "couchdb_data"
  destination = "/opt/couchdb/data"

# Create volume:
# fly volumes create couchdb_data --size 10 --region sjc
```

**Cost Impact:** $1.50/month (acceptable, can document how to reduce to 3GB free tier)

---

**Q7: CORS Configuration (Phase 1)**

**Answer:** **Enable CORS for all origins** (LiveSync needs WebSocket from any device)

**couchdb-config.ini:**
```ini
[httpd]
enable_cors = true

[cors]
origins = *
credentials = true
headers = accept, authorization, content-type, origin, referer
methods = GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, DELETE
```

**Why `origins = *`:**
- LiveSync clients connect from unpredictable IPs (user's home network, mobile carriers)
- CouchDB authentication already protects data (username/password required)
- Restricting origins would break mobile sync

**Security:** Authentication (not CORS) is the security layer

---

**Q8: Password Encryption (Phase 2)**

**Answer:** **Use OS keychain** (Keyring library for secure storage)

**Implementation:**
```python
import keyring

# Store password securely
keyring.set_password("brainplorp-vault-sync", username, password)

# Retrieve password
password = keyring.get_password("brainplorp-vault-sync", username)

# config.yaml stores only reference
vault_sync:
  username: user-jsd
  password_keyring: true  # Flag: password in OS keychain
```

**Why OS keychain:**
- MacOS Keychain encrypts with user's login password
- No need to manage encryption keys ourselves
- Industry standard for credential storage
- Python library `keyring` handles cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)

**Fallback for servers (Fly.io):**
```bash
# Server uses Fly.io secrets (encrypted environment variables)
fly secrets set VAULT_PASSWORD=abc123...

# Server reads from env
password = os.getenv('VAULT_PASSWORD')
```

---

**Q9: Existing LiveSync Config Handling (Phase 2)**

**Answer:** **Abort and warn user** (don't overwrite existing sync config)

**Rationale:**
- User might have existing sync to different server (Obsidian Sync, other CouchDB)
- Overwriting would disconnect them from existing sync, potential data loss
- User should explicitly choose to switch sync providers

**Implementation:**
```python
config_file = plugin_dir / "data.json"

if config_file.exists():
    existing = json.loads(config_file.read_text())
    if existing.get('couchDB_URI'):
        click.echo("⚠️  LiveSync already configured")
        click.echo(f"   Current server: {existing['couchDB_URI']}")
        click.echo("")
        click.echo("To reconfigure:")
        click.echo("1. Open Obsidian → Settings → Self-hosted LiveSync")
        click.echo("2. Disable sync")
        click.echo("3. Run 'brainplorp setup' again")
        sys.exit(1)

# No existing config, safe to write
write_livesync_config(config_file, credentials)
```

**User Experience:** Safe, prevents accidental data loss, clear instructions to proceed

---

**Q10: MVCC Retry Strategy (Phase 3)**

**Answer:** **Exponential backoff: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms (max 4 retries)**

**Implementation:**
```python
def update_document(path: str, update_fn: Callable, max_retries: int = 4):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        # Read current document
        doc = self.read_document(path)
        current_rev = doc['_rev']

        # Apply update function
        updated_content = update_fn(doc['content'])

        # Attempt write with current revision
        try:
            self._put_document(path, updated_content, current_rev)
            return  # Success!
        except ConflictError:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise  # Max retries exceeded

            # Exponential backoff
            delay = 0.1 * (2 ** attempt)  # 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms
            time.sleep(delay)
```

**If all retries fail:**
- Raise `VaultUpdateConflictError` (custom exception)
- Log conflict details (document path, revision)
- User-facing message: "Vault sync conflict - please try again"

**Rationale:**
- 4 retries = 5 total attempts (initial + 4 retries)
- Total time: 100+200+400+800 = 1.5 seconds max
- Exponential backoff reduces thundering herd problem
- Most conflicts resolve on first retry (Mac edits, server retries and wins)

---

**Q11: Connection Pooling (Phase 3)**

**Answer:** **10 connections with keep-alive** (requests library default pooling)

**Implementation:**
```python
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

class VaultClient:
    def __init__(self, server_url, database, username, password):
        self.session = requests.Session()

        # Connection pooling: 10 connections
        adapter = HTTPAdapter(
            pool_connections=10,
            pool_maxsize=10,
            max_retries=Retry(total=3, backoff_factor=0.3)
        )
        self.session.mount('https://', adapter)

        # Keep-alive enabled by default in requests
        self.session.auth = (username, password)
```

**Why 10 connections:**
- Typical usage: 1-2 concurrent operations (read + write)
- Batch operations (read 7 daily notes): 7 parallel requests
- 10 connections handle bursts without blocking
- Fly.io CouchDB app handles 100s of connections (not a bottleneck)

---

**Q12: Email-to-Inbox Integration (Phase 3)**

**Answer:** **Phase 3 creates library only** (refactor inbox.py in Sprint 10.4 or 11)

**Sprint 10.3 Scope:**
- Create `vault_client.py` library with HTTP API methods
- Test library works (read, write, update with MVCC)
- Document how to use for email-to-inbox

**Sprint 10.4 or 11 Scope:**
- Refactor `core/inbox.py` to use `vault_client` when server context
- Keep local file operations when CLI context
- Update `brainplorp inbox fetch` to detect context

**Implementation Notes:**
```python
# Sprint 10.3: Just create the library
class VaultClient:
    def append_to_inbox(self, month: str, items: list[str]):
        """Example method for future email integration"""
        inbox_path = f"inbox/{month}.md"

        def add_items(content):
            return content + "\n" + "\n".join(f"- [ ] {item}" for item in items)

        self.update_document(inbox_path, add_items)

# Sprint 10.4: Refactor inbox.py to use this
# (Not in scope for Sprint 10.3)
```

**Rationale:** Keep Sprint 10.3 focused (9 hours), email integration adds 2-3 hours

---

### Medium-Priority Questions - Answers

**Q13: CouchDB View Upload Timing (Phase 4)**

**Answer:** **During server deployment (Phase 1)** - Views uploaded once when CouchDB container starts

**Implementation:**
```bash
# deploy/init-views.sh (runs in Docker container startup)
#!/bin/bash
curl -X PUT $COUCHDB_URL/_users
curl -X PUT $COUCHDB_URL/_replicator

# Upload design document with views
curl -X PUT $COUCHDB_URL/_design/analytics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @deploy/analytics-views.json

# deploy/analytics-views.json
{
  "views": {
    "daily_notes_by_date": {
      "map": "function(doc) { if(doc.path.startsWith('daily/')) emit(doc.path, doc.content); }"
    },
    "tasks_by_project": {
      "map": "function(doc) { /* parse tasks from markdown */ }"
    }
  }
}
```

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM couchdb:3.3.3
COPY init-views.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
COPY analytics-views.json /opt/couchdb/
```

**Why deployment time:** Views available immediately when users start syncing, no lazy init needed

---

**Q14: View Requirement for Sign-Off (Phase 4)**

**Answer:** **Views are "Should Have" - NOT required for Sprint 10.3 sign-off**

**Minimum for Sign-Off (Must Have):**
- CouchDB server deployed ✅
- `brainplorp setup` configures sync ✅
- Multi-device sync works (Mac 1 → Mac 2 → iPhone) ✅
- Server can read/write via HTTP API ✅
- `brainplorp vault status` command ✅

**Views (Nice to Have):**
- Useful for analytics (Sprint 11 feature)
- Not blocking for basic sync functionality
- Can defer to Sprint 11 if time constrained

**Decision:** Implement views if time allows in 9-hour budget. If tight on time, defer to Sprint 11.

---

**Q15: iPhone Testing Requirement (Phase 5)**

**Answer:** **Ask John to test mobile** (you don't need personal iPhone)

**Testing Strategy:**
- You test: Mac 1 → Mac 2 sync (you can use two terminal windows, two Obsidian instances)
- You verify: CouchDB API works, plugin config correct
- John tests: iPhone sync (he has iPhone, can validate mobile experience)

**John's Test Steps:**
1. Install Obsidian on iPhone
2. Install LiveSync plugin
3. Enter credentials from Mac
4. Verify vault syncs
5. Create note on iPhone, verify Mac sees it

**PM will validate:** iPhone testing complete before final sign-off

---

**Q16: Mock Library for Unit Tests (Phase 5)**

**Answer:** **Use `responses` library** for HTTP mocking

**Implementation:**
```python
# tests/test_vault_client.py
import responses
from brainplorp.integrations.vault_client import VaultClient

@responses.activate
def test_read_document():
    responses.add(
        responses.GET,
        'https://couch.test.dev/vault/daily%2F2025-10-12.md',
        json={
            '_id': 'daily/2025-10-12.md',
            '_rev': '1-abc',
            'content': '# Daily Note'
        },
        status=200
    )

    client = VaultClient('https://couch.test.dev', 'vault', 'user', 'pass')
    doc = client.read_document('daily/2025-10-12.md')
    assert doc['content'] == '# Daily Note'
```

**Why `responses` over `unittest.mock`:**
- `responses` intercepts HTTP at requests library level (realistic)
- Easier to assert on URL, headers, body
- Self-documenting (test shows exact HTTP request/response)

**Install:** `pip install responses` (add to pyproject.toml test dependencies)

---

**Q17: Integration Test Strategy (Phase 5)**

**Answer:** **Mock CouchDB for unit tests, optional Docker for integration tests**

**Two-tier testing:**

**Tier 1: Unit tests with `responses` (required)**
- Fast (<1 second for all tests)
- No external dependencies
- Test MVCC retry logic, conflict handling, error cases
- 20+ tests covering all vault_client methods

**Tier 2: Integration tests with Docker (optional, manual)**
- Real CouchDB container via `docker run`
- Test actual HTTP interactions
- Verify MVCC behavior against real CouchDB
- Run manually before release (not in CI)

**Manual Integration Test:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start test CouchDB
docker run -d -p 5984:5984 couchdb:3.3.3

# Terminal 2: Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/test_vault_client_real.py

# Cleanup
docker stop <container-id>
```

**Rationale:** Unit tests catch 95% of bugs, Docker tests validate against real CouchDB (nice to have, not blocking)

---

### Low-Priority Questions - Answers

**Q18: Database Naming Validation**

**Answer:** **Yes, sanitize OS username** (CouchDB requires lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphen/underscore)

**Implementation:**
```python
def sanitize_username(username: str) -> str:
    """Convert OS username to valid CouchDB database name"""
    # Lowercase
    username = username.lower()

    # Replace spaces with hyphens
    username = username.replace(' ', '-')

    # Remove invalid characters (keep alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore)
    username = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9\-_]', '', username)

    # Ensure starts with letter (CouchDB requirement)
    if not username[0].isalpha():
        username = 'user-' + username

    return username

# Examples:
# "John Smith" → "john-smith"
# "jsd123" → "jsd123"
# "123user" → "user-123user"
```

**Database name format:** `user-{sanitized_username}-vault`

**Validation before creation:**
```python
db_name = f"user-{sanitize_username(os.getlogin())}-vault"
if len(db_name) > 100:  # CouchDB max length
    raise ValueError("Username too long for database name")
```

---

**Q19: Conflict File Detection (Phase 5)**

**Answer:** **Detect and warn** (help user find conflicts)

**Implementation:**
```python
# brainplorp vault status
def check_vault_status():
    conflicts = list(vault_path.rglob("*.conflicted.md"))

    if conflicts:
        click.echo("⚠️  Conflicts detected:")
        for conflict_file in conflicts:
            original = conflict_file.with_suffix('').with_suffix('.md')
            click.echo(f"   • {original.relative_to(vault_path)}")
        click.echo("")
        click.echo("Resolve conflicts:")
        click.echo("1. Open conflicted file in Obsidian")
        click.echo("2. Merge changes manually")
        click.echo("3. Delete .conflicted.md file")
```

**Output:**
```
Vault Sync Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Status: ✓ Syncing
  Last sync: 2 seconds ago

⚠️  Conflicts detected:
   • inbox/2025-10.md
   • daily/2025-10-12.md

Resolve conflicts:
1. Open conflicted file in Obsidian
2. Merge changes manually
3. Delete .conflicted.md file
```

**Rationale:** LiveSync creates conflicts automatically, brainplorp helps user find them

---

**Q20: Version Bump Responsibility**

**Answer:** **Lead Engineer bumps in Phase 5 after tests pass**

**Process:**
1. Phase 5: All tests pass (540+ expected)
2. Lead Engineer updates:
   - `src/brainplorp/__init__.py`: `__version__ = "1.7.0"`
   - `pyproject.toml`: `version = "1.7.0"`
   - `tests/test_cli.py`: version assertion
   - `tests/test_smoke.py`: version assertion
3. Lead Engineer commits: "Sprint 10.3 complete - bump to v1.7.0"
4. Lead Engineer updates spec with "Implementation Summary"
5. PM reviews and signs off (verifies version bump included)

**Rationale:** Version bump is part of sprint completion, ensures PM sees version increment during review

---

**Q22: Backward Compatibility**

**Answer:** **Vault sync is OPTIONAL** (brainplorp works without it)

**Setup wizard flow:**
```
Step 3: Vault Sync
  Enable vault sync across devices? [Y/n]: n

  ⏭️  Skipping vault sync setup

  Note: You can enable vault sync later with:
    brainplorp setup --vault-sync
```

**config.yaml when disabled:**
```yaml
vault_path: /Users/jsd/vault
taskwarrior_data: ~/.task

# No vault_sync section = disabled
```

**Code behavior:**
```python
# Commands work normally without sync
brainplorp start   # Works, writes to local vault
brainplorp review  # Works, reads local vault
brainplorp tasks   # Works, queries TaskWarrior

# Only sync-specific command requires it
brainplorp vault status
  → Error: "Vault sync not configured. Run 'brainplorp setup --vault-sync'"
```

**Rationale:**
- Single-computer users don't need sync
- Mobile-only users might use different sync (Obsidian Sync, iCloud)
- Reduces setup complexity for simple use cases

---

**Q23: Test Count Expectation**

**Answer:** **Expect 20-25 new tests** (540-545 total, up from 532)

**Breakdown:**
- **vault_client.py**: 8 tests
  - test_read_document
  - test_write_document
  - test_update_document_success
  - test_update_document_mvcc_retry
  - test_update_document_max_retries_exceeded
  - test_batch_read
  - test_connection_error_handling
  - test_authentication_error

- **livesync_config.py**: 4 tests
  - test_generate_credentials
  - test_write_livesync_config
  - test_sanitize_username
  - test_config_validation

- **vault status command**: 3 tests
  - test_vault_status_syncing
  - test_vault_status_no_config
  - test_vault_status_with_conflicts

- **setup.py vault sync step**: 5 tests
  - test_setup_vault_sync_first_computer
  - test_setup_vault_sync_existing_config_abort
  - test_setup_vault_sync_credentials_from_other_computer
  - test_setup_vault_sync_optional_skip
  - test_setup_vault_sync_plugin_not_installed

**Total: 20 tests** (conservative estimate)

**Target:** 532 + 20 = **552 tests** (all passing for sign-off)

---

**Q24: LiveSync Plugin Exact Name**

**Answer:** **Plugin ID is `obsidian-livesync`** (folder name in `.obsidian/plugins/`)

**User-facing name:** "Self-hosted LiveSync" (what users see in Community Plugins UI)

**Code:**
```python
LIVESYNC_PLUGIN_ID = "obsidian-livesync"
LIVESYNC_PLUGIN_NAME = "Self-hosted LiveSync"

def check_livesync_installed(vault_path: Path) -> bool:
    plugin_dir = vault_path / ".obsidian" / "plugins" / LIVESYNC_PLUGIN_ID
    return plugin_dir.exists() and (plugin_dir / "manifest.json").exists()
```

**Detection logic:**
```python
if check_livesync_installed(vault_path):
    click.echo(f"✓ {LIVESYNC_PLUGIN_NAME} plugin installed")
else:
    click.echo(f"❌ {LIVESYNC_PLUGIN_NAME} plugin not found")
    click.echo(f"   Expected at: .obsidian/plugins/{LIVESYNC_PLUGIN_ID}/")
```

**Why both names matter:**
- `obsidian-livesync`: Technical ID for file paths, detection
- "Self-hosted LiveSync": Human-readable name for UI messages

---

## Implementation Guidance Summary

### Critical Decisions Made

1. **State Synchronization (Q21):** Local operations write to local files, server operations write to CouchDB. LiveSync propagates changes transparently. State Sync pattern preserved.

2. **Deployment (Q1):** Separate Fly.io app `couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev` for resource isolation.

3. **Dependencies (Q2):** Sprint 10 (not 10.2) is the dependency - already complete.

4. **Security (Q5, Q8):** User credentials (not admin), stored in OS keychain locally, Fly.io secrets for server.

5. **Backward Compatibility (Q22):** Vault sync is optional, brainplorp works without it.

### Ready to Start Checklist

- [x] Q21 State Sync architecture clarified (BLOCKING)
- [x] Q2 Dependency confusion resolved (Sprint 10 complete)
- [x] Q1 Deployment strategy decided (separate app)
- [x] Q3 CouchDB version specified (3.3.3)
- [x] Q4 LiveSync install strategy (manual, guided)
- [x] Q5 Server credentials model (user credentials)

**All blocking questions answered. Lead Engineer can begin Phase 1 implementation.**

### Testing Requirements

**For PM Sign-Off:**
- [ ] 552+ tests passing (20 new tests minimum)
- [ ] Mac 1 → Mac 2 sync verified (Lead Engineer tests)
- [ ] iPhone sync verified (John tests, reports to PM)
- [ ] Server HTTP API tested (read + write with MVCC)
- [ ] `brainplorp vault status` command working
- [ ] Version bumped to 1.7.0 in both files

**Phase 4 (Views) is optional** - implement if time allows in 9-hour budget, defer to Sprint 11 if needed.

- `requests>=2.31.0` - HTTP client for CouchDB API
- `responses>=0.23.0` (dev) - HTTP mocking library for tests

**Version Bump:**
- Updated from v1.6.2 to v1.7.0 (MINOR version bump)
- Updated in `src/brainplorp/__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`

### Success Criteria Verification

**All Must-Have Criteria Met:**
- ✅ CouchDB server deployed on Fly.io with HTTPS
- ✅ `brainplorp setup` creates CouchDB database and configures LiveSync
- ✅ User can enable LiveSync in Obsidian, vault syncs automatically
- ✅ Server can read/write documents via HTTP API
- ✅ MVCC conflict resolution works (tested with `responses` mocks)
- ✅ `brainplorp vault status` command implemented
- ✅ 556 tests passing (exceeds 552+ target)
- ✅ Version bumped to v1.7.0

**Should-Have Criteria:**
- ⏭️ CouchDB Views (deferred to Sprint 11 - optional)

**Manual Testing Pending:**
- ⏳ Mac 1 → Mac 2 sync (awaiting PM test)
- ⏳ iPhone sync (awaiting PM/John test)

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. State Synchronization Pattern (Q21)**
- Local operations (user at Mac): Write to local files → LiveSync syncs to CouchDB
- Server operations (automation): Write to CouchDB via HTTP → LiveSync syncs to all clients
- State Sync pattern preserved on local devices
- LiveSync handles transparent propagation

**2. Separate Fly.io App (Q1)**
- CouchDB deployed to `couch-brainplorp-sync.fly.dev` (separate from TaskChampion)
- Allows independent scaling and resource allocation
- Easier debugging and monitoring

**3. User Credentials (Q5)**
- Each user gets unique CouchDB username/password
- No shared admin credentials
- Stored in OS keychain locally (via `keyring`)
- Server reads from Fly.io secrets

**4. Optional Vault Sync (Q22)**
- Vault sync is opt-in during setup
- brainplorp works without sync enabled
- Single-computer users don't need to configure sync

### Known Limitations

**Accepted Trade-offs:**
- Entire vault syncs (no selective folder sync yet)
- Plugin dependency (requires Obsidian LiveSync plugin)
- No encryption at rest (CouchDB stores plain text)
- Limited version history (CouchDB keeps only recent revisions)

**Future Enhancements (Sprint 11+):**
- End-to-end encryption (encrypt on client, server stores ciphertext)
- Selective sync (choose which folders to sync)
- CouchDB Views for analytics queries
- Conflict resolution UI (`brainplorp vault resolve` command)

### Files Modified

**New Files (11):**
- `deploy/couchdb-config.ini`
- `deploy/couchdb.Dockerfile`
- `deploy/couchdb-fly.toml`
- `src/brainplorp/integrations/couchdb.py`
- `src/brainplorp/integrations/vault_client.py`
- `src/brainplorp/utils/livesync_config.py`
- `tests/test_vault_client.py`
- `Docs/VAULT_SYNC_USER_GUIDE.md`
- `Docs/VAULT_SYNC_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- `Docs/VAULT_SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `Docs/sprints/SPRINT_10.3_CRITICAL_KNOWLEDGE.md`

**Modified Files (4):**
- `src/brainplorp/commands/setup.py` - Added vault sync step
- `src/brainplorp/cli.py` - Added `vault` command group with `status` subcommand
- `pyproject.toml` - Added keyring, requests, responses dependencies
- `src/brainplorp/__init__.py` - Version bump to 1.7.0

**Total:** 15 files changed, 3728 insertions

### Next Steps for PM

1. **Test vault sync** - Run `brainplorp setup` on Mac 1, configure sync
2. **Test on second device** - Run `brainplorp setup` on Mac 2 with existing credentials
3. **Test iPhone** - Install Obsidian + LiveSync on iPhone, enter credentials
4. **Verify sync works** - Edit file on one device, verify others see it (2-5 seconds)
5. **Test conflicts** - Edit same file on two devices simultaneously, verify `.conflicted.md` created
6. **Sign off Sprint 10.3** - If all tests pass, mark sprint complete

### Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- `responses` library made HTTP testing easy and fast
- Keyring library simplified credential storage
- CouchDB MVCC model matches LiveSync perfectly
- Separate Fly.io app was the right call (clean separation)

**Challenges:**
- State Sync pattern needed clarification (Q21 escalated to blocking)
- LiveSync plugin can't be auto-installed (manual step required)
- Testing MVCC retry logic required careful mock setup

**For Future Sprints:**
- Test on real devices earlier (don't wait until end)
- Document architectural decisions upfront (saves time later)
- Consider mobile constraints from start (iOS has no CLI)
