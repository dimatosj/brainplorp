# Sprint 9 Spec: General Note Management & Vault Interface via MCP

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** üìã DRAFT - Planning Phase
**Sprint:** 9
**Estimated Effort:** 18-20 hours
**Dependencies:** Sprint 6 (MCP architecture), Sprint 7 (/process workflow), Sprint 8 (project management)
**Architecture:** MCP-First, General Vault Access
**Date:** 2025-10-08

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 9 transforms plorp from a "TaskWarrior + Daily Notes bridge" into a **general Obsidian vault interface** accessible via MCP. This enables Claude Desktop to read, write, search, and organize notes throughout the vault - not just daily notes, inbox, and projects.

**Key Innovation:** Provide **low-level note I/O primitives** via MCP tools, allowing Claude to apply intelligence to vault management. Users can say "read all SEO notes and summarize" or "update project doc with today's notes" - Claude combines multiple tools to accomplish complex workflows.

**What's New:**
- Read/write any markdown file in vault (not just specific folders)
- Search notes by tags, frontmatter fields, headers, content
- Folder operations (read all notes in folder with filtering)
- Section-level editing (update specific headers without rewriting entire note)
- Pattern detection (find project-like headers, extract bullets, analyze structure)
- Context-aware content management (prevent context exhaustion)

**User Experience:**
```
User: "Read the sprint 9 spec"
Claude: [reads Docs/sprints/SPRINT_9_SPEC.md, full content now in context]

User: "Read all docs in /Docs but ignore /Docs/archive"
Claude: [scans folder, reads 12 docs, excludes archive/]

User: "Append this bug report to the sprint 9 doc"
Claude: [appends content to ## Bugs section]

User: "Find all SEO notes and report back ready to work on a new idea"
Claude: [searches tag:SEO, reads 5 notes, synthesizes summary]
```

---

## Vision: Recreating Claude Code Experience in MCP

### What Users Want to Say

**Things users currently say to Claude Code:**
- "Read all docs in folder"
- "Read only the docs in /docs, ignore subdirectory /docs/archive"
- "Add this bug report to the sprint 9 doc"
- "Update readme"
- "Update handoff.md with everything we did in this session"

**Things users want to say to Claude via plorp MCP:**
- "Read this doc"
- "Read the docs in this folder"
- "Append this to this doc"
- "Update the project document with the notes from today's note"
- "Read all notes labeled SEO and report back ready to work on a new idea"
- "Find ### headers that are projects, create project notes if they don't exist"

### Two Categories of Operations

#### 1. Deterministic Operations (Direct Tool Calls)
- **Read specific note** ‚Üí `plorp_read_note(path)`
- **Read folder with filters** ‚Üí `plorp_read_folder(path, recursive, exclude)`
- **Append content** ‚Üí `plorp_append_to_note(path, content)`
- **Update section** ‚Üí `plorp_update_note_section(path, header, content)`
- **Search by tag** ‚Üí `plorp_search_notes_by_tag(tag)`
- **Create note anywhere** ‚Üí `plorp_create_note_in_folder(folder, title, content)`

**Characteristic:** Clear input ‚Üí clear action. No interpretation needed.

#### 2. Stochastic/Intelligent Operations (Claude Decides)
- **"Read all SEO notes and summarize"** ‚Üí Search + read multiple + Claude synthesizes
- **"Update project doc with today's notes"** ‚Üí Read daily note + extract relevant content + append to project (Claude decides "relevant")
- **"Find project from header or create it"** ‚Üí Pattern match headers + search existing + ask user for domain if not found
- **"Organize these notes by topic"** ‚Üí Claude reads content, reasons about categories, calls tools to move/tag files

**Characteristic:** Claude combines multiple tools and applies intelligence to accomplish goal.

**Key Insight:** MCP tools provide **capabilities**, Claude provides **intelligence**.

---

## How MCP Tools Work with Context

### The Core Question

**Does content returned by MCP tools enter Claude's context?**

**Answer: YES.** It works exactly like Claude Code's Read tool.

### The Flow

```
1. User: "Read the sprint 9 spec"
   ‚Üì
2. Claude calls: plorp_read_note("Docs/sprints/SPRINT_9_SPEC.md")
   ‚Üì
3. Tool executes: plorp reads markdown file
   ‚Üì
4. Tool returns: {
     "path": "Docs/sprints/SPRINT_9_SPEC.md",
     "content": "# Sprint 9 Spec\n\n## Goals\n...[full 5000 words]...",
     "word_count": 5000,
     "headers": ["Goals", "Architecture", "Implementation"]
   }
   ‚Üì
5. Claude receives: Full content in tool result block
   ‚Üì
6. Content enters context: Claude can now reference, quote, analyze
   ‚Üì
7. User asks: "What are the main goals?"
   ‚Üì
8. Claude answers: [references content from step 4, no re-read needed]
```

### Comparison: Claude Code vs MCP Tools

| Aspect | Claude Code | plorp MCP Tools |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Content in context** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Can reference later** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Counts toward context** | ‚úÖ Yes (200k tokens) | ‚úÖ Yes (200k tokens) |
| **Context warnings** | ‚úÖ Built-in alerts at 60% | ‚ùå No automatic warnings |
| **Large file handling** | ‚úÖ offset/limit params | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement |
| **Pagination** | ‚úÖ Can read in chunks | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement |
| **Folder recursion** | ‚úÖ Glob patterns | ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement |

### Implications for Design

**This means the workflows WILL work:**

‚úÖ **"Read all SEO notes"**
- plorp returns all note contents (up to reasonable limit)
- Claude sees all content in context
- Claude can synthesize across notes
- **Limitation**: If 10 notes √ó 2000 words = 20k tokens used

‚úÖ **"Read sprint 9 spec then add bug report"**
- First call: Read spec ‚Üí full content in context
- Claude sees current structure
- Second call: Append to correct section
- Claude references context to know where to append

‚úÖ **"Update project with today's notes"**
- Read daily note ‚Üí content in context
- Read project doc ‚Üí content in context
- Claude sees both, decides what's relevant
- Claude calls append with synthesized content

**But we need to be careful:**
- Reading 50 notes could exhaust context window
- Large files (20k+ words) could consume too much context
- Need smart defaults (limits, previews, metadata-first)

---

## Goals

### Primary Goals (Must Have)

1. **Enable general note read/write operations**
   - Read any markdown file in vault (not just daily/inbox/projects)
   - Write/append to any note
   - Update specific sections without rewriting entire file
   - Create notes in arbitrary folders

2. **Provide folder operations**
   - Read all notes in folder (with filtering)
   - List vault structure
   - Search notes by metadata (tags, frontmatter fields)

3. **Context-aware content management**
   - Return previews for large files
   - Limit folder scans to reasonable defaults
   - Provide metadata-first search (defer full reads)
   - Warn when operations might consume excessive context

4. **Maintain backward compatibility**
   - Existing daily/inbox/project workflows unchanged
   - New tools are additive, not replacements
   - High-level workflows coexist with low-level primitives

### Secondary Goals (Nice to Have)

5. **Pattern detection and extraction**
   - Detect project-like headers (### Project Name)
   - Extract bullet points from specific sections
   - Parse document structure (headers, links, tags)

6. **CLI wrappers for note operations**
   - `plorp note read <path>` for power users
   - `plorp note search <query>` for testing
   - Optional - MCP is primary interface

### Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

- ‚ùå Full-text search across vault (defer to Obsidian's search or external tools)
- ‚ùå Semantic search / embeddings (Sprint 10+)
- ‚ùå Automatic note organization / AI classification (Sprint 10+)
- ‚ùå Real-time file watching / sync (not needed for MCP workflow)
- ‚ùå Obsidian plugin integration / REST API calls (file system only)

    line_number: int    # 0-indexed line in content
```

#### Phase 3: Intelligent Workflows (Stochastic - Week 3)

**No new functions - documentation for Claude on combining tools.**

**Workflow Documentation:** `Docs/MCP_WORKFLOWS.md`

```markdown
## Workflow Patterns for Claude

### Pattern 1: "Read all notes with tag X"

**User says:** "Read all SEO notes and summarize"

**Claude's approach:**
1. plorp_search_notes_by_tag(tag="SEO")
   ‚Üí Returns list of 5 notes with metadata
2. Check total word count across notes
   - If < 10k words: Read all notes fully
   - If > 10k words: Ask user which notes to read, or read previews
3. For each selected note:
   plorp_read_note(path, mode="full")
4. Synthesize summary across all content in context

**Context management:**
- Metadata search first (cheap)
- Selective full reads (expensive)
- Claude decides based on word_count fields

---

### Pattern 2: "Update project doc with today's notes"

**User says:** "Update the website redesign project with today's notes"

**Claude's approach:**
1. plorp_read_note("daily/2025-10-08.md")
   ‚Üí Gets today's full note in context
2. plorp_extract_headers(content, level=3)
   ‚Üí Finds ### headers (potential project sections)
3. plorp_extract_bullets(content, section="website redesign")
   ‚Üí Gets bullets under that header
4. plorp_search_notes_by_field(field="project_name", value="website-redesign")
   ‚Üí Finds project note at projects/work.marketing.website-redesign.md
5. plorp_read_note("projects/work.marketing.website-redesign.md")
   ‚Üí Gets current project doc in context
6. **Claude decides** what's relevant from bullets
7. plorp_append_to_note("projects/work.marketing.website-redesign.md", relevant_content)
   ‚Üí Adds notes under ## Notes section

**Intelligence applied:**
- Claude determines "relevant" (not all bullets belong in project)
- Claude formats content appropriately
- Claude may ask user for confirmation before appending

---

### Pattern 3: "Find or create project from header"

**User says:** "Check if there are projects in today's note and create them if missing"

**Claude's approach:**
1. plorp_read_note("daily/2025-10-08.md")
   ‚Üí Full content in context
2. plorp_detect_projects_in_note(content)
   ‚Üí Finds ["website redesign", "api rewrite"]
3. For each potential project:
   a. plorp_search_notes_by_field(field="project_name", value="website-redesign")
   b. If found: Report "Project exists at [path]"
   c. If not found: Ask user for domain/workstream
   d. plorp_create_project(name, domain, workstream)
4. Report results

**Decision points:**
- Claude interprets which headers are projects (not "Tasks", "Notes", etc.)
- Claude asks user for missing metadata (domain)
- Claude can batch questions ("I found 2 new projects, both look like work domain - confirm?")

---

### Pattern 4: "Read docs folder excluding archive"

**User says:** "Read all docs in /Docs but ignore /Docs/archive"

**Claude's approach:**
1. plorp_read_folder(
     folder_path="Docs",
     recursive=true,
     exclude=["archive"],
     limit=50,
     mode="metadata"
   )
   ‚Üí Gets list of ~30 docs with metadata
2. Check total_count vs returned_count
   - If has_more=true: Ask user if they want to see all or filter
3. Ask user: "Found 30 docs. Read all, or specify which ones?"
4. Based on user response:
   - Option A: Read all (if <20 docs and <50k total words)
   - Option B: Show list, user picks specific ones
   - Option C: Read structure only (headers) for all
5. For selected docs:
   plorp_read_note(path, mode="full")

**Context management:**
- Metadata first (cheap operation)
- Ask before bulk read (avoid context exhaustion)
- Adaptive based on size
```

---

## Context Management Strategy

### The Problem

Reading many large files can exhaust Claude's 200k token context window:
- 10 notes √ó 5,000 words = ~50k words = ~65k tokens (~33% of context)
- 50 notes √ó 2,000 words = ~100k words = ~130k tokens (~65% of context)
- Sprint 8 spec alone = ~15k words = ~20k tokens (~10% of context)

**Without limits, users could accidentally consume entire context in 2-3 tool calls.**

### Design Principles

1. **Metadata-first**: Search returns metadata (path, title, word_count) before content
2. **Lazy loading**: Claude decides which notes to read fully
3. **Smart defaults**: Conservative limits that can be overridden
4. **Preview modes**: Offer truncated content for large files
5. **Warn, don't block**: Tell user if operation is expensive, let them decide

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Mode Parameter (All Read Operations)

```python
mode = "full" | "preview" | "metadata" | "structure"

# full - Entire content (default for single notes)
# preview - First 1000 characters + "..." + metadata
# metadata - Frontmatter only
# structure - Headers only (no body content)
```

**Example:**
```python
# Large file warning
result = read_note("Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md", mode="full")
if result["word_count"] > 10000:
    return {
        ...result,
        "warning": "This note is 15,000 words. Consider mode='preview' or 'structure' to save context."
    }
```

#### 2. Folder Scan Limits

```python
read_folder(path, limit=10, mode="metadata")

# Default: 10 notes, metadata only
# Max: 50 notes
# Returns: has_more flag if total_count > limit
```

**Example:**
```python
result = read_folder("notes", recursive=True)
# {
#   "notes": [...10 notes with metadata...],
#   "total_count": 47,
#   "returned_count": 10,
#   "has_more": true,
#   "suggestion": "Use limit=50 to see all, or filter with exclude=[...]"
# }
```

#### 3. Search Result Batching

```python
search_notes_by_tag("SEO", limit=20)

# Returns metadata for first 20 matches
# Claude can then selectively read_note() for specific ones
```

**Example workflow:**
```
1. User: "Read all SEO notes"
2. Claude: search_notes_by_tag("SEO") ‚Üí 15 notes found
3. Claude checks: Sum of word_counts = 35,000 words (~45k tokens)
4. Claude decides: "Too large, ask user"
5. Claude: "Found 15 SEO notes (35k words total). Should I:
   - Read all (will use ~45k tokens = 22% of context)
   - Show you the list so you can pick specific ones
   - Read structure only (headers from each note)"
6. User chooses
```

#### 4. Adaptive Response Formatting

When returning large content, include usage hints:

```python
{
  "path": "Docs/SPRINT_8_SPEC.md",
  "content": "[... 15,000 words ...]",
  "word_count": 15000,
  "estimated_tokens": 19500,
  "context_usage": "~10% of 200k token budget",
  "suggestion": "If you only need specific sections, use plorp_get_section_content() instead"
}
```

#### 5. Scope Control via Config

**Config file: `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml`**

```yaml
vault_path: /Users/jsd/vault

# Note access control (Sprint 9)
note_access:
  # Folders plorp can read/write
  allowed_folders:
    - notes
    - projects
    - daily
    - inbox
    - Docs
    - _bases

  # Folders to always exclude from scans
  excluded_folders:
    - .obsidian
    - .trash
    - templates

  # Max file sizes
  max_file_size_kb: 500  # Warn if note > 500KB

  # Context protection
  max_folder_read: 50    # Max notes per folder scan
  warn_large_file_words: 10000  # Warn if note > 10k words
```

**Security model:**
- **Default:** Read/write only in allowed_folders
- **Override:** User can add folders to allowed list
- **Protection:** Never read .obsidian config or .trash
- **Transparency:** Tool returns error if path outside allowed folders

---

## Existing Sprint 9 Candidates (from Sprint 8)

### Sprint 9 Candidates (Validation & Cleanup)

**Note:** These were originally planned for Sprint 9 but may be **deferred to Sprint 10** given the scope of general note management.

1. **Hybrid workstream validation** (from Sprint 8 Q7)
   - CLI: Prompt for confirmation if workstream not in suggested list
   - MCP: Claude warns about unusual workstreams

2. **Project sync command** (from Sprint 8 Q3)
   - `plorp project sync <full-path>` to clean up orphaned task UUIDs
   - Validates all task_uuids, removes deleted tasks from frontmatter

3. **Orphaned project review workflow**
   - Interactive workflow to assign workstream to 2-segment projects
   - Batch process projects with `needs_review: true`

4. **Orphaned task review workflow**
   - Help user assign domain/project to tasks with `project.none:`
   - Low-friction capture ‚Üí organize later pattern

5. **Clarify `/process` vs `/review` workflow boundaries** (from Sprint 8 discussion)
   - **Current confusion**: `/process` only converts informal tasks (no UUID) ‚Üí formal tasks (with UUID)
   - **Gap identified**: No automatic sync when user checks off formal tasks in daily note
   - **User expectation**: Checking a box in Obsidian should mark task done in TaskWarrior
   - **Options to evaluate**:
     - A: Keep workflows separate (current design - `/process` = conversion, `/review` = sync)
     - B: Extend `/process` Step 2 to also sync checkbox state for formal tasks
     - C: Create new `plorp sync` command specifically for checkbox ‚Üí TaskWarrior sync
     - D: Make checkbox sync automatic on daily note read (background process)
   - **Decision needed**: Clarify workflow responsibilities and determine if duplication is acceptable

**PM Decision Point:** Evaluate Sprint 9 scope and potentially defer items 1-4 to Sprint 10 if general note management takes full sprint.

## Dependencies

### Required from Previous Sprints

**Sprint 6 (MCP Architecture):**
- ‚úÖ MCP server infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Tool registration system
- ‚úÖ TypedDict-based returns

**Sprint 7 (/process workflow):**
- ‚úÖ Markdown parsing utilities
- ‚úÖ Section extraction patterns
- ‚úÖ Daily note structure knowledge

**Sprint 8 (Project Management):**
- ‚úÖ Obsidian Bases integration patterns
- ‚úÖ Frontmatter parsing
- ‚úÖ Folder scanning utilities

### External Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- PyYAML (existing dependency)
- pathlib (standard library)
- re (standard library)
- Obsidian vault at configured path

### Configuration

**Requires:** `~/.config/plorp/config.yaml` with `note_access` section:
```yaml
note_access:
  allowed_folders:
    - notes
    - projects
    - daily
    - inbox
    - Docs
```

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Context Exhaustion

**Risk:** Users accidentally consume entire 200k context with bulk reads.

**Mitigation:**
- Smart defaults (limit=10, mode="metadata")
- Warnings for large files/folders
- Metadata-first approach
- Documentation emphasizes selective reading

**Monitoring:** Include context usage hints in tool responses.

---

### Risk 2: Permission/Security Issues

**Risk:** User accidentally gives plorp access to sensitive folders or files.

**Mitigation:**
- Whitelist approach (allowed_folders in config)
- Never read .obsidian or .trash by default
- Clear error messages when accessing forbidden paths
- Documentation explains security model

**Testing:** Unit tests verify permission enforcement.

---

### Risk 3: Breaking Existing Workflows

**Risk:** New note operations conflict with daily/inbox/project workflows.

**Mitigation:**
- New tools are **additive**, not replacements
- Existing high-level workflows unchanged
- Low-level primitives coexist with high-level workflows
- Regression tests for all Sprint 1-8 functionality

**Testing:** Full test suite must pass before Sprint 9 sign-off.

---

### Risk 4: Performance Degradation

**Risk:** Scanning large vaults is slow.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement limits and pagination
- Use generators for large folder scans
- Cache folder structure (future optimization)
- Profile operations during testing

**Acceptable:** <2s for folder with 100 notes, <5s for metadata search across 1000 notes.

---

## Open Questions

### Q1: Should note access be unrestricted or whitelist-based?

**Context:** Users might want to read notes in custom folders not in default list.

**Options:**
- A: Unrestricted - Read/write anywhere in vault (max flexibility)
- B: Whitelist with easy config override (recommended)
- C: Prompt for confirmation outside known folders (interactive)

**Recommendation:** Option B. Config file allows power users to expand, default is safe.

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# Default allowed_folders
allowed_folders: [notes, projects, daily, inbox, Docs]

# User can add custom folders
allowed_folders: [notes, projects, daily, inbox, Docs, journal, ideas]
```

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING - Need user input

---

### Q2: Should plorp cache folder structure or scan on every call?

**Context:** Scanning vault/notes with 500+ files might be slow.

**Options:**
- A: No caching - Scan filesystem every time (simple, always fresh)
- B: Cache folder structure, invalidate on write (complex, faster)
- C: Cache with TTL (5 minute expiry) (balanced)

**Recommendation:** Option A for Sprint 9, Option C for Sprint 10 if needed.

**Rationale:**
- Sprint 9 focus is getting functionality working
- Optimize only if performance issues arise
- Obsidian users don't create hundreds of notes per hour
- Caching adds complexity (invalidation, stale data)

**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - No caching in Sprint 9

---

### Q3: How should plorp handle notes edited outside plorp?

**Context:** User might edit note in Obsidian while Claude has old content in context.

**Options:**
- A: Ignore - Not plorp's responsibility (recommended for Sprint 9)
- B: Add "last modified" timestamp check (warn if stale)
- C: Re-read note before every write (slow, safe)

**Recommendation:** Option A. Claude Desktop sessions are short (<1 hour typically).

**Future:** Option B in Sprint 10 if users report issues.

**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - No staleness detection in Sprint 9

---

### Q4: Should CLI commands be created for note operations?

**Context:** All operations accessible via MCP. CLI wrappers are optional.

**Options:**
- A: MCP-only (recommended for Sprint 9)
- B: Add CLI wrappers: `plorp note read <path>`, `plorp note search <query>`
- C: Add only most useful CLI commands (read, search)

**Recommendation:** Option A. MCP is primary interface. Add CLI in Sprint 10 if users request.

**Rationale:**
- Sprint 9 scope is already large
- CLI adds development time with minimal user benefit
- Power users can use Obsidian's built-in search
- MCP tools provide full functionality via Claude Desktop

**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - No CLI wrappers in Sprint 9

---

### Q5: How to handle malformed frontmatter or invalid markdown?

**Context:** User notes might have syntax errors, broken YAML, etc.

**Options:**
- A: Strict - Return error if frontmatter invalid (fails early)
- B: Lenient - Parse what's possible, skip broken frontmatter (forgiving)
- C: Hybrid - Warn about issues but still return content (recommended)

**Recommendation:** Option C.

**Implementation:**
```python
result = read_note("notes/broken.md")
# {
#   "content": "[full content even if frontmatter broken]",
#   "metadata": {},  # Empty if parse failed
#   "warnings": ["Could not parse YAML frontmatter: expected key:value on line 3"]
# }
```

**Rationale:**
- Obsidian is forgiving with markdown
- Users may have notes from other systems
- Better to return partial data than fail completely
- Warnings inform without blocking

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING - Implementation decision
