# Instructions for New Claude Instance

## Your Task
You need to understand the PLORP codebase. Follow these steps IN ORDER.

## Step 1: Read Core Documentation (Read These First)
Read these documents to understand the system:
  /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/:
  - plorp_SPEC.md - System requirements and boundaries
  - plorp_ARCHITECTURE.md - Component design and data flow
  - plorp_TASKWARRIOR_INTEGRATION.md 
  - plorp_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Feature status and roadmap


## What NOT to Read
- Skip everything in `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/archive/`
- Skip test files initially unless needed for your task

## Remember
1. First understand the system
3. Find where the scope parsing happens
4. Implement the syntax change
5. Test thoroughly
