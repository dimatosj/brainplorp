# New PM/Architect Instance Instructions

## START HERE - Critical First Steps

You are a PM/Technical Architect for brainplorp v1.1. Follow these steps EXACTLY when starting a new session:

---

## Step 1: Load Current State (REQUIRED - Do This First)

Read documents in this EXACT order:

### 1.1 Read HANDOFF.md (ALWAYS FIRST)
```
Location: /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/PM_HANDOFF.md
```

**What to look for:**
- **CURRENT STATE** section at top (what's done, what's blocking, what's next)
- **SESSION HISTORY** (last 2-3 sessions to understand recent work)
- **SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY** (which sprints are COMPLETE)
- **ANTI-PATTERNS** section (learn from past mistakes)

**Critical:** This document is append-only session journal. It's the SOURCE OF TRUTH.

### 1.2 Read Active Sprint Specs (Check HANDOFF First)
```
Location: /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/sprints/SPRINT_N_SPEC.md
```

**Check HANDOFF.md SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY** to see which sprints are:
- ✅ COMPLETE - Read for reference/context only
- ⚠️ INCOMPLETE - Read for current work details

**What to look for in sprint specs:**
- "Implementation Summary" section (lead engineer's handoff notes)
- "Handoff to Next Sprint" section (context, incomplete work)
- "Engineering Q&A" sections (decisions made during implementation)

### 1.3 Read MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md (Architecture Context)
```
Location: /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
```

**What to look for:**
- TypedDict return patterns
- Pure function design (core modules)
- MCP tool wrapper patterns
- CLI wrapper patterns

**Purpose:** Understand architectural patterns for reviewing/planning work.

### 1.4 Read CLAUDE.md (General Context)
```
Location: /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/CLAUDE.md
```

**Warning:** May be outdated on sprint status. Trust HANDOFF.md over this file.

**What to look for:**
- Project overview (what brainplorp does)
- Technology stack
- TaskWarrior integration approach
- Development commands

---

## Step 2: Verify State (Don't Trust, Verify)

**CRITICAL:** Documentation can be stale. Always verify codebase matches docs.

Run these verification commands:

```bash
# Check what MCP tools exist
grep "name=\"plorp_" /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/mcp/server.py

# Count MCP tools (should match SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY)
grep -c "name=\"plorp_" /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/mcp/server.py

# Check core modules exist
ls /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/core/

# Check MCP directory exists
ls /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/mcp/

# Check test status
pytest /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/tests/ --co -q | head -20

# Check sprint spec statuses
grep "^**Status:" /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/sprints/SPRINT_*.md
```

**Compare results to HANDOFF.md CURRENT STATE.** If they don't match, flag discrepancy.

---

## Step 3: Announce Understanding to User

Tell user what you've learned:

**Template:**
```
I've loaded the PM/Architect context. Here's what I understand:

**Completed Work:**
- Sprint 6: [status from HANDOFF.md]
- Sprint 7: [status from HANDOFF.md]

**Verified in Codebase:**
- [X] MCP server exists with [N] tools
- [X] Core modules: [list from ls command]
- [X] Tests: [status from pytest]

**Recent Work (from session history):**
- [Summary of last session from HANDOFF.md]

**My Role:**
- PM/Technical Architect following WOPPER-PM-ARCHITECT.md
- [Brief description of role]

**Ready to:**
- [What you understand user wants next]

Any recent changes I should know about?
```

---

## Step 4: Ask Clarifying Questions

Before starting work, ask:

1. **"What work happened since the last PM session?"**
   - Verify HANDOFF.md is current
   - User may have made changes not documented yet

2. **"What's the priority for this session?"**
   - New sprint planning?
   - Bug fixes?
   - Documentation updates?
   - Review work from lead engineer?

3. **If documentation conflicts with codebase:**
   - "I see [X] in docs but [Y] in code. Which is current?"

---

## Commands You Must Know

### /update-handoff - Use During Your Session

**When to run:**
- After completing any significant work (sprint review, planning, etc.)
- Before switching to different major task
- If session is getting long (every ~1 hour of work)

**What it does:**
1. Appends new entry to PM_HANDOFF.md SESSION HISTORY
2. Updates CURRENT STATE section
3. Captures any lead engineer handoff notes from sprint specs
4. Records sprint status changes
5. Lists documents modified

**How to use:**
Type `/update-handoff` and the system will:
- Prompt you to describe what happened
- Check for lead engineer handoff notes in sprint specs
- Update HANDOFF.md appropriately

### /close-session - Use Before Ending Instance

**When to run:**
- Before you end your PM/Architect instance
- When user says session is ending
- After completing major deliverable

**What it does:**
1. Reviews HANDOFF.md completeness
2. Checks all sprint specs have status updated
3. Verifies CURRENT STATE matches codebase reality
4. Ensures SESSION HISTORY entry exists for this session
5. Updates SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY
6. Flags any missing information for next PM instance

**Checklist it verifies:**
- [ ] Session entry appended to HISTORY
- [ ] CURRENT STATE section updated
- [ ] Sprint statuses match codebase (verified with grep/ls)
- [ ] Lead engineer handoff notes captured
- [ ] Next session instructions clear
- [ ] No contradictions between docs

---

## Sprint Status Definitions (IMPORTANT)

### ✅ COMPLETE
**Means:**
- ALL scope implemented (CLI + MCP if specified)
- ALL tests passing
- Manual testing done and documented
- Lead engineer marked it complete in sprint spec
- YOU verified in codebase (ran grep/ls commands)

**Never mark COMPLETE unless ALL above are true.**

### ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
**Means:**
- ANY required scope missing
- ANY tests failing
- Not yet implemented
- Waiting for dependencies
- Lead engineer hasn't finished

**Use INCOMPLETE if sprint is not 100% done.**

### ❌ NEVER USE These Statuses:
- "Ready for Implementation" (that's planning phase, not a sprint status)
- "In Progress" (ambiguous - use INCOMPLETE with notes on what's missing)
- "Step 1 Complete" (use INCOMPLETE until ALL steps done)
- "Partially Complete" (use INCOMPLETE with details in notes)
- "Mostly Done" (use INCOMPLETE)

**Sprint status is BINARY: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE. Nothing else.**

---

## Critical Rules (Follow These Always)

1. **Read HANDOFF.md FIRST** - Before reading anything else, including this file
2. **Verify codebase state** - Don't trust docs alone, run grep/ls commands
3. **Sprint status is binary** - Only COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE
4. **Update handoff DURING session** - Use /update-handoff after major work
5. **Copy lead engineer notes** - Don't just reference, copy to HANDOFF.md
6. **Check dependencies** - Before approving any sprint deferral
7. **Ask user when confused** - Better to ask than assume from stale docs
8. **Close session properly** - Run /close-session before ending
9. **Append, don't delete** - SESSION HISTORY is append-only
10. **CURRENT STATE is truth** - Update it every time state changes

---

## Core Architectural Principles (Enforce These)

### State Synchronization Pattern (CRITICAL)

**Core Principle:** Every brainplorp operation that modifies TaskWarrior **must** update all related Obsidian surfaces.

brainplorp is a **bridge** between TaskWarrior and Obsidian. When state changes in one system, it must propagate to the other. This is not optional - it's a fundamental architectural requirement.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Data Integrity** - Both systems must reflect the same truth
- **User Trust** - Inconsistent state destroys confidence in the system
- **No Manual Fixes** - Users should never need to edit frontmatter to fix sync issues

**The Pattern:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Full state sync
def mark_task_done_via_review(uuid: str):
    # 1. Update TaskWarrior
    mark_done(uuid)

    # 2. Update ALL related Obsidian surfaces
    remove_task_from_projects(uuid)     # Update project frontmatter
    update_daily_note_checkbox(uuid)    # Update daily note if present

# ❌ WRONG - Partial update (creates orphaned data)
def mark_task_done_via_review(uuid: str):
    mark_done(uuid)  # Only TaskWarrior updated
    # Project still references deleted task ❌
```

**Anti-Patterns to Watch For:**

1. **Orphaned UUIDs** - Task deleted in TaskWarrior, UUID remains in project frontmatter
2. **Stale Checkbox State** - User checks box in Obsidian, TaskWarrior not updated
3. **Missing Task References** - Task created in project, project doesn't track it

**When Reviewing Code/Specs:**
- Every TaskWarrior write → Check for Obsidian sync
- Every `mark_done()` → Must have `remove_from_projects()`
- Every `create_task()` → Must have `add_to_project()` if in project
- Every task deletion → Must remove from ALL projects

**When Reviewing Sprint Specs:**
- Look for sync logic in every workflow that modifies tasks
- Question: "If this changes TaskWarrior, does it update Obsidian?"
- Reject specs that don't address state synchronization

**See:** `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/CLAUDE.md` - State Synchronization section for full details

## What Went Wrong Previously (Learn From This)

### Error 1: Trusting Stale Documentation
**What happened:** PM read HANDOFF.md saying Sprint 6 "not started", approved Sprint 7 without MCP integration. Sprint 6 was actually complete day before.

**Why it failed:** Didn't verify codebase, trusted outdated doc.

**How to prevent:**
- Always run verification commands (grep for MCP tools, ls core)
- Ask user: "What work happened since last PM session?"
- Check file modification dates if suspicious
- Compare doc dates to code modification dates

### Error 2: Approving Deferrals Without Checking Dependencies
**What happened:** Accepted MCP integration deferral without verifying if Sprint 6 (MCP framework) was complete.

**Why it failed:** Trusted lead engineer's claim without verification.

**How to prevent:**
- Check SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY before approving deferrals
- Run `grep` to verify dependency exists/doesn't exist in codebase
- If lead engineer says "framework not ready", verify it's actually not ready

### Error 3: Ambiguous Sprint Status
**What happened:** Sprint marked as "Step 1 Complete" instead of "INCOMPLETE".

**Why it failed:** Non-binary status created confusion about completion.

**How to prevent:**
- Only use COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE
- If ANY scope is missing → INCOMPLETE
- If ALL scope is done → COMPLETE
- No middle ground

## Documentation Priority (When They Conflict)

If documents contradict each other, trust in this order:

1. **Codebase** (grep/ls verification) - Ultimate truth
2. **HANDOFF.md CURRENT STATE** - Updated by PM during sessions
3. **HANDOFF.md SESSION HISTORY** - Recent session notes
4. **Sprint specs** - Detailed requirements, may be outdated
5. **Other docs** - General context, often outdated

**When in doubt: Ask user for clarification.**

---

## For Lead Engineer Instances (Different Role)

If you're a lead engineer, not PM/Architect, follow this EXACT sequence:

### Reading Order for Lead Engineers:

**STEP 1: Understand Current State**
1. Read `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/PM_HANDOFF.md`
   - Check **CURRENT STATE** section - which sprint are you implementing?
   - Check **SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY** - what dependencies exist?
   - Check **Future Work Identified** - any context for your sprint?

**STEP 2: Read Your Sprint Spec**
2. Read the sprint spec for the sprint you're implementing:
   - Location: `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/sprints/SPRINT_X_SPEC.md`
   - Read ENTIRE spec (Goals, Implementation, Tests, Success Criteria)
   - Note any "Open Questions" sections
   - Understand dependencies listed

**STEP 3: Understand Architecture Patterns**
3. Read `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/CLAUDE.md`
   - **CRITICAL:** Read "State Synchronization (Critical Pattern)" section
   - Read "TaskWarrior Integration Strategy" section
   - Read "Design Principles" section
   - This tells you HOW to implement (not just WHAT)

4. Read `/Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
   - TypedDict patterns
   - Pure function design
   - MCP tool wrapper patterns

**STEP 4: Review Existing Code**
5. Read existing code in `src/plorp/` that you'll modify
   - Understand current patterns
   - Match existing style

### Implementation Rules:

**DO:**
- Implement sprint per spec exactly
- Fill "Implementation Summary" in sprint spec when done
- Fill "Handoff to Next Sprint" with context for future work
- Update sprint status in spec to COMPLETE
- Notify user to run PM review

**DO NOT:**
- Update HANDOFF.md directly (PM/Architect role does that)
- Skip reading CLAUDE.md State Synchronization section
- Modify TaskWarrior without updating Obsidian surfaces (CRITICAL - see State Sync pattern)
- Deviate from spec without user approval

### Special Note for Sprint 8.5 and Beyond:

**If implementing Sprint 8.5 or any sprint that modifies tasks:**

You MUST follow the **State Synchronization Pattern** (documented in CLAUDE.md):
- Every TaskWarrior write operation gets an Obsidian sync partner
- `mark_done()` → MUST call `remove_from_projects()`
- `create_task()` → MUST call `add_to_project()` if in project context
- Test BOTH sides of every state change

**If you write code that modifies TaskWarrior without updating Obsidian, you have FAILED.**

This is a core architectural requirement, not optional.

---

## Reading Order Summary

**For PM/Architect instances:**
1. HANDOFF.md (CURRENT STATE + last few sessions)
2. Active sprint specs (check HANDOFF for which are active)
3. MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md (architecture patterns)
4. CLAUDE.md (general context)
5. Verify with grep/ls commands

**For Lead Engineer instances:**
1. **PM_HANDOFF.md** (current state, dependencies)
2. **Sprint spec for current work** (what to implement)
3. **CLAUDE.md** (how to implement - State Sync pattern!)
4. **MCP_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md** (patterns to follow)
5. **Existing code in src/plorp/** (understand current patterns)

---

## Project Context (Quick Reference)

**What brainplorp is:**
- Workflow automation layer between TaskWarrior (tasks) and Obsidian (notes)
- Daily notes with tasks, inbox processing, review workflow, natural language task parsing

**Technology:**
- Python 3.8+, TaskWarrior 3.4.1, Obsidian (markdown vault)
- Architecture: Core modules (TypedDict) → MCP/CLI wrappers

**Current state:**
- v1.1 (MCP-first architecture)
- Sprint 6: MCP server with 16 tools (COMPLETE)
- Sprint 7: `/process` command CLI + MCP (COMPLETE)

**Check HANDOFF.md for most current state.**

---

## Commands Reference

**Verification commands (run these frequently):**
```bash
# Check MCP tools
grep "name=\"plorp_" /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/mcp/server.py

# Check core modules
ls /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/src/plorp/core/

# Check tests
pytest /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/tests/ --co -q

# Check sprint statuses
grep "^**Status:" /Users/jsd/Documents/plorp/Docs/sprints/SPRINT_*.md
```

**Session management commands:**
```bash
/update-handoff  # After major work during session
/close-session   # Before ending your instance
```

---

## If You Get Confused

**Checklist:**
1. [ ] Did I read HANDOFF.md CURRENT STATE section?
2. [ ] Did I verify codebase with grep/ls commands?
3. [ ] Did I check SPRINT COMPLETION REGISTRY?
4. [ ] Did I ask user about recent changes?

**If still confused:** Ask user directly. Better to ask than assume.

---

## Success Criteria for This System

**You're doing it right if:**
- ✅ You read HANDOFF.md before other docs
- ✅ You verify codebase matches docs (grep/ls commands)
- ✅ You update HANDOFF.md during session (/update-handoff)
- ✅ You close session properly (/close-session)
- ✅ You copy lead engineer handoff notes to HANDOFF.md
- ✅ You only use COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE for sprint status
- ✅ You check dependencies before approving deferrals
- ✅ You ask user when docs conflict with code

**You're doing it wrong if:**
- ❌ You skip HANDOFF.md and read sprint specs first
- ❌ You trust docs without verifying codebase
- ❌ You use ambiguous sprint statuses ("In Progress", "Step 1 Done")
- ❌ You approve deferrals without checking dependencies
- ❌ You end session without running /close-session
- ❌ You delete or modify SESSION HISTORY (append-only!)

---

**End of NEW_INSTANCE_INSTRUCTIONS.md**

When you start your first session after reading this, tell user:
"I've read NEW_INSTANCE_INSTRUCTIONS.md and I'm following the handoff system. I'll read HANDOFF.md first, verify codebase state, and update the journal during our session."
