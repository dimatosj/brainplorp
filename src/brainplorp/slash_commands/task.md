Help me create a task in TaskWarrior using brainplorp MCP tools.

Steps:
1. Ask me for the task details:
   - Description (required)
   - Due date (optional, in YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Priority (optional: H, M, or L)
   - Project (optional)
2. Offer to create a linked note for this task if it needs documentation
3. If yes, use `plorp_create_note_with_task` to create both
4. If no note needed, create just the task (you'll need to use the TaskWarrior integration directly or guide me to use the CLI)
5. Confirm the task was created successfully

Be helpful in gathering all the information needed!
